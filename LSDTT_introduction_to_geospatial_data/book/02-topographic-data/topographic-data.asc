== Topographic data

Much of what we do using *LSDTopoTools* is process topographic data. 

Topographic data comes in a number of formats, but at a basic level most topographic data is in the form of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics[*raster*].

Topographic data is almost always *single band*: each pixel or cell only has one data value: the elevation. Derivative topographic data, such a slope or aspect, also tends to be in single band rasters.

It is possible to get topographic data that is not in raster format (that is, the data is not based on a grid).
Occasionally you find topographic data built on unstructured grids, or point clouds, where each elevation data point has a location in space associated with it.
This data format takes up more space than raster data,
since on a aster you only need to supply the elevation data:
the horizontal positions are determined by where the data sits in the grid.
Frequently https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar[LiDAR] data
(LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging, and is a method for obtaining very high resolution topographic data)
is delivered as a point cloud and you need software to convert the point cloud to a raster.

For most of this book, we will assume that your data is in raster format.
