== Data sources

Before you can start analysing topography and working with topographic data,
you will need to get data and then get it into the correct format.
This page explains how to do so.

If you would like to learn more about global topographic datasets you can read this review chapter by one of the authors of *LSDTopoTools*:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444641779000047 (most universities have access to this chapter, if you don't have access just email Simon and he will send it to you).

=== What data does LSDTopoTools take?

IMPORTANT: Although *LSDTopoTools* works with three data formats, the only one that retains georeferenceing information (where you are in space) is the *ENVI bil* format, so we highly recommend you convert all data to *ENVI bil*. 

IMPORTANT: Do not mix *ESRI bil* format with *ENVI bil* format! *They are not the same!* You need to use *ENVI bil*. 

The LSDTopoTools works predominantly with raster data;
if you don't know what that is you can read about it here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_data.
In most cases, the raster data you will start with is a digital elevation model (DEM).
Digital elevation models (and rasters in general) come in all sorts of formats. LSDTopoTools works with three formats:

.File input and output options
|===
|Data type
|file extension
|Description

|http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOTOOLS/ArcInfo+ASCII+Grid+format#ASCIIGrid[Ascii]
|`.asc`
|This format is in plain text and can be read by a text editor.
The advantage of this format is that you can easily look at the data,
but the disadvantage is that the file size is extremely large (compared to the other formats, .flt).

|Float
|`.flt` with a header file with extension `.hdr`.
|This is a binary file format meaning that you can't use a text editor to look at the data.
The file size is greatly reduced compared to `.asc` data, however. This format does not retain georeferencing information.

|http://www.exelisvis.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html[ENVI bil format] 
|`.bil` with a header file with extension `.hdr`.
|**This is the recommended format**, because it works best with GDAL (see  the section <<GDAL>>),
and because it retains georeferencing information. 

|===


.Why don't we use GeoTiff?
****
https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/[GeoTIFF] is a widely used raster format that has the advantage of containing georeferencing and the raster data in a single file. 
The disadvantage is that for pass:[C++] code you need to have two libraries (`libtiff` and `libgeotiff`) installed before you can read GeoTIFF files. 
Because there are many open source, easily installed tools for converting GeoTIFF files 
(for example, the http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html[GDAL utilities] and the https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/[python GDAL bindings])
we have opted for portability and not included the GeoTIFF libraries in our software. If you have GeoTIFF files, you
will need to convert them to a supported format before using LSDTopoTools. 
****

Below you will find instructions on how to get data into the correct format: 
data is delivered in a wide array of formats (e.g., ESRI bil, DEM, GeoTiff) 
and you must convert this data before it can be used by LSDTopoTools. 

=== Downloading data

If you want to analyse topography, you should get some topographic data!
The last decade has seen incredible gains in the availability and resolution of topographic data.
Today, you can get topographic data from a number of sources. The best way to find this data is through search engines,
but below are some common sources:

=== Global datasets

There are several global topographic datasets. 

* The oldest of these is https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/GTOPO30[gtopo30], 
which was completed in 1996 and contains ~1 km resolution global data. 
* This was followed by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)]
that produced a 90 meter resolution DEM in 2003. 
* SRTM was followed by the 
https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)]
30 meter resolution global DEM in 2009. 
* In 2014 
http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1[SRTM released a global 30 meter dataset]. 
* 2015 has seen the release of the http://www.geo-airbusds.com/worlddem/[WorldDEM], a 12 meter resolution topographic dataset. 
* There are now a bunch of 30m datasets. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444641779000047[Here is a paper about that (sorry, paywall)]. If you don't have access to that paper then please email Simon Mudd and request a copy.
* A least of easily accesible global datasets can be found here: https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog?group=global


.What global dataset should I use??
*******************************************
For 30m resolution topographic data, we recommend either ALOSW3D 30 or Copernicus30. We tend to use the latter more frequently in our research, although in some mountain regions the former is better able to resolve the channels. 
*******************************************

.Where to get global data
*******************************************
Our python toolkit, *lsdviztools*, has some functions for getting these global datasets. See our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdtt_notebooks[jupyter notebooks] for instructions. 

That toolkit uses the API from http://www.opentopography.org/[opentopography.org]. You can also download data directly from them. I cannot say enough good things about *opentopography*.
