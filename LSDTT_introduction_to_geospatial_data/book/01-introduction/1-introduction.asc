== Introduction

This documentation is about geospatial data. We focus on how to obtain geospatial data and how to manipulate it using, primarily, the GDAL command line tools. 

=== Two basic kinds of geospatial data

Geospatial data comes in two primary types: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_data[raster data] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics[vector data].

You can read in greater detail about different geospatial data formats https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats[on wikipedia], but the basic data structures are:

* Raster data is data that is distributed on a grid. 
** A raster is just a grid of data, where each cell in the grid has some value (or values).
** The cells are sometimes also called pixels. With image data, each pixel in the raster might have several values, such as the value of red, green and blue hues.
** Image data thus has *bands*: each band is the information pertaining to the different colors.
* Vector data is data that is a collection of points or polygons distributed in space. 
** "Vector" in the geospatial context doesn't mean the same thing as in a mathematial context: vector geospatial data includes any data that has vertices that can be anywhere in space.
** This contrasts with raster data where the data points are fixed in space, usually on a rectangular grid. 

In most GIS systems, the handling of these two data types are different and you load them with different buttons on your GIS. Below are the two buttons in QGIS 2.14. Usually the raster button looks a bit like a grid and the vector button looks a bit like some shapes with distinct points.

These different kinds of data have different file formats. There is are two linked software libraries for processing these data, called http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL] and http://gdal.org/1.11/ogr/[OGR]: they are commonly used in geospatial software so you should be able to convert between the data types that are read by these two packages.
