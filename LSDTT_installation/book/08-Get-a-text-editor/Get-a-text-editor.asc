== Get a text editor!

A text editor isn't part of *LSDTopoTools* but you need one to do anything. You will need to modify parameter files and you might even get to the stage of opening Pass:[c++] or Python scripts and editing them so you will need an editor. 

If you are Linux native you probably chortle superiorly if you lean someone doesn't use `vi` to modify files, but most students have usually only interacted with text files via a word processor. 

A word processor (e.g., *Word*, or whatever fasionable software is on your fruit-based computer) *will not work* to modify code: these convert your text into binary files and add a bunch of formatting. 

You need to work with raw `ascii` files, and for that you need a text editor. We like these:

* Brackets is a multi platform text editor (it works on all operating systems) and is free. It has nice file navigation. This documentation was written using Brackets. 
* Atom is another multi platform editor. Similar to Brackets. Also free. 
* PSPad is a freeware text editor (it will ask you occasionally for a donation). I quite like it for Pass:[c++] code and other code since it has a quite nice built-in function navigator.
