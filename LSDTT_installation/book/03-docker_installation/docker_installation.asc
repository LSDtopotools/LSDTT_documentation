== Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker

=== Should I use Docker or Vagrant?

There are https://deliciousbrains.com/vagrant-docker-wordpress-development/[many], https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/vs/docker.html[many], https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647069/should-i-use-vagrant-or-docker-for-creating-an-isolated-environment[many] https://www.devteam.space/blog/docker-vs-vagrant-which-is-better-for-development/[articles] comparing vagrant to docker.
The docker setup is probably a bit simpler than the vagrant setup but (_and this is a big but_) it won't work on a Windows machine unless you have Windows 10 Enterprise. It does work on any recent version of Linux and MacOS. However the developers of *LSDTopoTools* don't have access to Windows 10 Enterprise so can't test the Docker versions on Windows, so we can't offer support of this installation option.
However if you have MacOS, native Linux or Windows 10 Enterprise you should consider using Docker since it involves fewer steps than our VirtualBox+Vagrant setup.

=== The LSDTopoTools docker container

https://www.docker.com/[Docker] is software for creating and managing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization[containers]. These containers are not complete operating systems, like one creates using https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] and https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant], so the boot time is quicker. Docker is perhaps simpler to use but does not work on every operating system.

The instructions here are a slight modification of https://hub.docker.com/r/afriel/lsdtopotools/[instructions] from https://github.com/AaronFriel[Aaron Friel].

To set up *LSDTopoTools* using Docker:

. Download and install https://www.docker.com/docker-windows[Docker for Windows] (only works with Windows 10 enterprise), https://www.docker.com/docker-mac[Docker for Mac], or Docker for https://www.docker.com/docker-ubuntu[Ubuntu] or https://www.docker.com/docker-debian[Debian].

. On Mac we recommend installing docker using brew: `brew cask install docker`

. Create a folder where you are going to put files associated with docker. In the examples I will assume these are in `C:\DockerBoxes\LSDTopoTools\`.

. Run the following command in a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe[command prompt] or https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac[terminal for Mac] or Linux (if you use Linux I am sure you don't need instruction on how to open a terminal):
+
[source, console]
----
docker run --rm -it -v C:\DockerBoxes\LSDTopoTools\:/LSDTopoTools afriel/lsdtopotools
----
+
Note that you will need to modify the path (here `C:\DockerBoxes\LSDTopoTools\`) to reflect your own directory where you want your LSDTopoTools files.
+
. You should get a prompt that looks like this, perhaps with some different
letters and numbers after the @:
[source, console]
----
root@9f73030d8598:/LSDTopoTools#
----
. If this is your first time using the tools and your LSDTopoTools directory is
empty, you will need to run the install script. In the prompt, enter:
`install.sh` and hit `enter`.
+
. Some users have reported permissions problems with running `install.sh` on a fresh docker install. If this happens you need to run this command `chmod 0744 /bin/install.sh` to update the permissions on the install script and then run `install.sh` as normal.
+
. Follow docker documentation for your operating system to start and shut down docker containers.
