== Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker

You can read about Docker here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)
Basically it is a system for running containers, which are little pre-built computing environments. 
There are alternatives (podman, singularity) but Docker is the most popular and widely available. 

In practice, the *LSDTopoTools* developers have installed everything on a container so you don't have to do any of that work. You just start the container and then start analysing topography. 

=== Install docker

To install docker, follow these instructions: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

For Windows, you first need to activate Windows Linux Subsystem 2. This is easy but you will need administrative permissions. The instructions are here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10. But basically all you need is a powershell with admin permissions and you run `wsl --install`. Easy peasy. 

=== Once you have docker

. Before you do anything you need to create an `LSDTopoTools` directory on your host operating system that you will share with the *LSDTopoTools* docker containers. 
.. We will assume this is in `C:\LSDTopoTools` on Windows 
.. Or `\LSDTopoTools` on MacOS and Linux. 
. Pull the full *LSDTopoTools* container and run it with a linked volume:
+
.. For windows:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v C:/LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker
----
+
.. For MacOS or Linux:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v /LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker
----
+
.. Or if you have a different directory to LSDTopoTools data on your host machine:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v /PATH/TO/YOUR/DATA:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker
----
+
. The first time you do this it will need to download and unpack the container. It is ~4Gb so that will take a while. Have a good book ready. 
. When the container starts up you are ready to run *LSDTopoTools*
+
. If you want our example data you can run:
+
[source,console]
----
# Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
+
You only need to do this once. 
+
. When you are finished with your docker session type `ctrl+d`.


=== If you are a developer

If you are not planning on writing *LSDTopoTools* code, ignore this bit. 

. Run the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v C:/LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pcl_docker
----
+
. This will grab a container that is used to compile *LSDTopoTools*
. You then need to clone the LSDTopoTools2 directory and compile it by going into the `/src` directory and running `sh build.sh`.
. The programs then end up in the `/LSDTopoTools/bin` directory so you will need to add that to your path.
