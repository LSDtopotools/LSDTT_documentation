=== Some notes on Docker

The direction of travel in portability seems to be away from https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] and toward https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. We are not quite sure why this is, since the https://docs.docker.com/[docker documentation] is similar to documentation for the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLDgQg6bq7o[turbo encabulator]. There are many people quite willing to mansplain why Docker is better but before you feel the urge to do that, please refrain: we have drank a bit of the kool-aid and have been testing *LSDTopoTools* with docker. 


==== Docker for Windows

I have not made any scientific study of this but most *LSDTopoTools* users are on Windows operating systems. 

Firstly, you need to have *Windows 10 enterprise*. It will not work otherwise. 

Second, if you have that and have it installed, you also need to add yourself to the `docker-users` group. To do that, do this (instructions from here: https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/868):

. Logon to Windows as Administrator
. Go to Windows Administrator Tools
. Look for Windows Computer Management and click on it.
. Or you can skip steps 1, right mouse clicking Computer Management, go to more, and select run as administrator and provide Administrator password.
. Double click docker-users group and add your account as member.
. Also add your account to Hyper-V Administrator. This was added when you installed docker for Windows.
. Log off from Windows and log back on.
. Click on Windows icon on bottom left and start Docker for Windows. This will start docker windows service.
. Start Windows Powershell and type docker --version. It will show Docker version 17.09.1-ce, build 19e2cf6. This is the latest version.
