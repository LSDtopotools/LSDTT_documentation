== Installing LSDTopoTools at the University of Edinburgh.

These instructions are for students and staff within the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh].

Our servers have the *LSDTopoTools* command line tools installed. So all you need to do is get on one of our servers. 


.Quick Setup for Edinburgh Geoscience users
************************************************************

. First, <<Mapping your network drive,map your network drive>>. Instructions are below.
. In the windows search bar, type "powershell" and start a windows powershell. 
. Type `ssh UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk`. 
. It will ask you a yes/no question about adding a key. Type `yes`. 
. Enter your EASE password. and enter your password. UUN is your university user name. 
. This puts you into the university ssh server, which is slow. Move into a better one by typing `ssh burn`. 
. You are now on a server that has the *LSDTopoTools*

=== Mapping your network drive

You will need access to your data on the network drive to use *LSDTopoTools*. You only need to do this one in any computer lab (and possibly only once ever):

. Open a file explorer window and under computer select the "University drive":

+
. Type `ssh UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk`. 
+
.Go onto a server using the ssh command. You must use your own university username (UUN)!
image::images/ssh_into_server.png[ssh onto server. Use your own UUN]
+
. It will ask you a yes/no question about adding a key. Type `yes`. 
+
. Enter your EASE password. and enter your password. UUN is your university user name. 
+
. This puts you into the university ssh server, which is slow. Move into a better one by typing `ssh burn`. 
+
IMPORTANT: You *MUST* move servers since the GeoSciences ssh server is very old and cannot run the software. 
+
.Go onto burn. You could also try `achray`

Alternatives to this method are programs called MobaXterm, putty, or secure shell client. But basically in all these you need to connect to the server `UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk` and then enter your password.
