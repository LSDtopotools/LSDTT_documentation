== Installing LSDTopoTools at the University of Edinburgh.

These instructions are for students and staff within the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh].

=== Mapping your network drive

You will need access to your data on the network drive to use *LSDTopoTools*. You only need to do this one in any computer lab (and possibly only once ever):

. Open a file explorer window and under computer select the "University drive":

=== Getting on to our servers with NX

. We will be working on the University of Edinburgh servers.

. First you should start an https://www.nomachine.com/[NX] session. NX is installed on all the computer labs in GeoScience (and in many other computer labs) Follow these instructions: https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/intranet/it/linux-servers/nx

. You will get something that looks like a desktop. Right click anywhere in the desktop and select "open terminal".


=== Using the LSDTopoTools setup script

. Before you do anything you need to move onto a decent server (the ssh server is only for logging in). Type either:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ssh burn
----
+
OR
+
[source,console]
----
$ ssh achray
----
+
. In this window type `cd ~`. This takes you to your home directory.
+
. Download our setup tool by typing:
+
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
. Run the setup tool by typing
+
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
. You should now have *LSDTopoTools* directories installed in your home directory. You can always get to your home directory by typing `cd ~`.
