== Installing LSDTopoTools at the University of Edinburgh.

These instructions are for students and staff within the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh].


.Quick Setup for Edinburgh Geoscience users
************************************************************
*If it is the first time you are using LSDTopoTools*

. In the windows search bar, look for *MobaXterm personal edition*.
. When you open this, click on the button that says *start local terminal*.
. In the terminal window, type `ssh UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk` and enter your password. UUN is your university user name. 
. This puts you into the university ssh server, which is slow. Move into a better one by typing `ssh burn`. 
. Go into your T: drive by entering: `cd /exports/csce/datastore/geos/users/UUN`
. Now enter: `git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2.git`
. Now enter: `cd LSDTopoTools2/src/`
. Now enter: `sh build.sh`
. You will need to wait a bit for this step. 
. Now enter: `cd ..`
. Finally enter: `sh lsdtt2_terminal.sh`

*If you have already followed the instructions above once*

. In the windows search bar, look for *MobaXterm personal edition*.
. When you open this, click on the button that says *start local terminal*.
. In the terminal window, type `ssh UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk` and enter your password. UUN is your university user name. 
. This puts you into the university ssh server, which is slow. Move into a better one by typing `ssh burn` 
. Go into your T: drive by entering: `cd /exports/csce/datastore/geos/users/UUN` 
. Now enter: `cd LSDTopoTools2`
. Finally enter: `sh lsdtt2_terminal.sh`

=== Mapping your network drive

You will need access to your data on the network drive to use *LSDTopoTools*. You only need to do this one in any computer lab (and possibly only once ever):

. Open a file explorer window and under computer select the "University drive":

+
. Then go into the Science and Engineering folder ("SCE"):

+
. Then into the GeoSciences folder ("GEOS"):

.The geosciences folder

+
. Then into the Drive Mapping folder ("drive_mapping"):

=== Getting on to our servers with MobaXterm

. Use the windows search to find the program *MobaXterm*.
. When you open this, click on the button that says *start local terminal*.
. In the terminal window, type `ssh UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk` and enter your password. UUN is your university user name. 
. This puts you into the university ssh server, which is slow. Move into a better one by typing `ssh burn`. 
. Go into your *T:* drive by entering: `cd /exports/csce/datastore/geos/users/UUN`


=== Cloning the LSDTopoTools2 repository

*LSDTopoTools2* lives in a https://github.com/[github] repository and you use a program names https://git-scm.com/[git] to get it. Don't worry, this is easy. 

. Type (or copy and paste): `git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2.git`
. It will download some stuff. Now you need to build the software. 

=== Building the software

. Type: `cd LSDTopoTools2/src`
. Type: `sh build.sh`
. Wait a bit until it finishes. It should take a minute or two. 

=== Making sure the software works

. Type `cd ..` (this puts you into the main *LSDTopoTools2* directory)
. Now type: `sh lsdtt2_terminal.sh`
. You can test the softare by typing: `lsdtt-basic-metrics` and see if it actually runs the program (it won't do any analysis yet but it will tell you to give it some files).
