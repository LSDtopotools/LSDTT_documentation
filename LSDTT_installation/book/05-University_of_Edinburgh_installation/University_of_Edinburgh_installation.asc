== Installing LSDTopoTools at the University of Edinburgh.

These instructions are for students and staff within the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh].


.Quick Setup for Edinburgh Geoscience users
************************************************************
. Start an https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/intranet/it/linux-servers/nx[nx session].
. Open a terminal window. 
. Go to your home directory: `cd ~`
. Download the setup tool:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
. Run the setup tool by typing
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 0
----
+
. See <<Testing the tool on Edinburgh servers,instructions below>> for testing the tool.

=== Mapping your network drive

You will need access to your data on the network drive to use *LSDTopoTools*. You only need to do this one in any computer lab (and possibly only once ever):

. Open a file explorer window and under computer select the "University drive":

+
. Then go into the Science and Engineering folder ("SCE"):

+
. Then into the GeoSciences folder ("GEOS"):

=== Getting on to our servers with NX

. We will be working on the University of Edinburgh servers.

. First you should start an https://www.nomachine.com/[NX] session. NX is installed on all the computer labs in GeoScience (and in many other computer labs) Follow these instructions: https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/intranet/it/linux-servers/nx

. You will get something that looks like a desktop. Right click anywhere in the desktop and select "open terminal".


=== Using the LSDTopoTools setup script

. Before you do anything you need to move onto a decent server (the ssh server is only for logging in). Type either:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ssh burn
----
+
OR
+
[source,console]
----
$ ssh achray
----
+
. In this window type `cd ~`. This takes you to your home directory.
+
. Download our setup tool by typing:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
. Run the setup tool by typing
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 0
----
+
. You should now have *LSDTopoTools* directories installed in your home directory. You can always get to your home directory by typing `cd ~`.

=== Testing the tool on Edinburgh servers

Now, if you want to test the tool:

. Go to the example data directory: `cd ~/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/`
. You want to add the path to the main program:
+
[source,console]
----
$ PATH=$PATH:~/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver;export PATH
----
+
IMPORTANT: This update to your path is only valid for your current terminal session. You will need to enter this command each time you start a new session. 
+
. Download the path modification tool:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTTParamfileUpdater.py
----
+
. run the tool
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTTParamfileUpdater.py
----
+
. Okay, now tes the program:
+
[source,console]
----
$ LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out . WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
. If the program does some things and then says `I'm all finished! Have a nice day.` it means it has worked!
