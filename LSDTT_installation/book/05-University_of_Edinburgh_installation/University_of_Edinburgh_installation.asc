== Installing LSDTopoTools at the University of Edinburgh.

These instructions are for students and staff within the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh].


.Quick Setup for Edinburgh Geoscience users
************************************************************
*If it is the first time you are using LSDTopoTools*

. First, <<Mapping your network drive,map your network drive>>. Instructions are below.
. In the windows search bar, type "powershell" and start a windows powershell. 
. Type `ssh UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk`. 
. It will ask you a yes/no question about adding a key. Type `yes`. 
. Enter your EASE password. and enter your password. UUN is your university user name. 
. This puts you into the university ssh server, which is slow. Move into a better one by typing `ssh burn`. 
. Download the setup script:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_Edinburgh_scripts/master/LSDTT_UEdin_setup.sh
----
+
. Now run the script:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sh LSDTT_UEdin_setup.sh
----
+

*If you have already followed the instructions above once*

. Go into the School of GeoScience servers using instructions above. 
. Run the script:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sh LSDTT_UEdin_setup.sh
----
************************************************************



=== Mapping your network drive

You will need access to your data on the network drive to use *LSDTopoTools*. You only need to do this one in any computer lab (and possibly only once ever):

. Open a file explorer window and under computer select the "University drive":
+
.The university drive

+
. Then go into the Science and Engineering folder ("SCE"):

+
. Then into the GeoSciences folder ("GEOS"):
+
.The geosciences folder

+
. Then into the Drive Mapping folder ("drive_mapping"):

+
. And finally double click the shortcut "Access Netdata":

=== Getting on to our servers with with ssh in a powershell window

. In the windows search bar, type "powershell" and start a windows powershell. 
. Type `ssh UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk`. 
. It will ask you a yes/no question about adding a key. Type `yes`. 
. Enter your EASE password. and enter your password. UUN is your university user name. 
. This puts you into the university ssh server, which is slow. Move into a better one by typing `ssh burn`. 

Alternatives to this method are programs called MobaXterm, putty, or secrue shell client. But basically in all these you need to connect to the server `UUN@ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk` and then enter your password. 

=== Downloading and running the setup script

. Navigate to your home directory
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
----
+
. Get the setup script from the internet
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_Edinburgh_scripts/master/LSDTT_UEdin_setup.sh
----
+
. Now run the script:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sh LSDTT_UEdin_setup.sh
----


IMPORTANT: Every time you start a new session, you will need to run this setup script. The second time you run it, it will not set up *LSDTopoTools*, but it will check the software for updates and it will also tell your computer where the actual programs are.  


==== Excruciatingly detailed information about what the script does

IMPORTANT: This is what the setup script does. *You don't need to do this if you have run the script!* It remains here for reference. 

. Go into your *T:* drive by entering: `cd /exports/csce/datastore/geos/users/UUN`
. Imagine having to type this every time you go into the servers. It is very annoying. You can cut that step out by making a symbolic link. 
. In linux you can always navigate to your home directory using:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
----
+
. You make a link using the `ln` command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ln -s /exports/csce/datastore/geos/users/UUN MyDataStore
----
+
IMPORTANT: You need to replace `UUN` above with your university user name. 
+
NOTE: You don't have to call the link `MyDataStore`, you can call it whatever you like. But try to remember what you called it. 
+
. Once you do that, you can navigate into your network drive in Linux with the commands:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
$ cd MyDataStore
----

===== Don't be messy

. You can organise your directories however you want, but I find it is easier to keep everything contained in a single *LSDTopoTools* directory. 
. Go into your network drive (see above).
. I suggest making a directory called `LSDTopoTools` (you can use `mkdir LSDTopoTools`).
. If you want to be clever, you can make an additional link to this new directory:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
$ ln -s /exports/csce/datastore/geos/users/UUN/LSDTopoTools LSDTT_Directory
$ cd LSDTT_Directory
----
+
IMPORTANT: You need to replace `UUN` above with your university user name.
+
. If you do that, whenever you want to go into your *LSDTopoTools directory, you just enter this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
$ cd LSDTT_Directory
----
+
. Do that in order to follow the next steps. 
. Inside this directory you can put the source code, any data or projects, and the python visualisation code. But in the next step we will just get the source code in set up the main *LSDTopoTools* programs. 

===== Cloning the LSDTopoTools2 repository

*LSDTopoTools2*, which has the main analysis programs, lives in a https://github.com/[github] repository and you use a program names https://git-scm.com/[git] to get it. Don't worry, this is easy. 

. Type (or copy and paste): `git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2.git`
. It will download some stuff. Now you need to build the software. 

===== Building the software

. Type: `sh lsdtt2_setup.sh`
. Wait a bit until it finishes. It should take a minute or two. 
. You can now navigate to your data and start using *LSDTopoTools*. See link:LSDTT_basic_usage.html[our section on first analyses in *LSDTopoTools*].

===== Starting an LSDTopoTools2 session after your first installation

* Whenever you return to run an *LSDTopoTools2* session, you will need to tell the computer where your program files are. You have two options:
** Run `sh lsdtt2_setup.sh` in the *LSDTopoTools2* directory. This gets the latest version of the software, recompiles, and points your session to the program files. 
** Run `sh lsdtt2_terminal.sh` in the *LSDTopoTools2* directory. This just points your session to the program files.
* You *must* do one of those two things otherwise your computer will not know where the program files are. 
* As an alternative, you can go into yor `.bashrc` file and add the `/path/to/LSDTopoTools2/bin` directory to your `$PATH`. You will need to change the full path to reflect your own directory system. If you don't know what a `.bashrc` file is you are probably better off running the `lsdtt2_terminal.sh` script. 


===== Getting the example data

. Create a data directory. The documentation assumes this directory structure:  +
| Your home directory (native linx) or the root directory (docker)  +
--|LSDTopoTools  +
----| LSDTopoTools2  +
------| subdirectories with source code and programs +
----| data  +
------| subdirectories with different projects +
----| Other LSDTopoTools directories (e.g., LSDMappingTools, LSDTT_documentation)
+
. So, if you don't have a data directory, make one. Again, we suggest putting this in your *LSDTopoTools* directory. Go into your LSDTopoTools directory (see <<Don't be messy,instructions above>>):
+
[source, console]
----
$ mkdir data
----
+
. Go into the data directory and grab the example data from github, then unzip and clean the zip file:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd data
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/SmallExampleTopoDatasets/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ mv ./SmallExampleTopoDatasets-master ./ExampleTopoDatasets
$ rm master.zip
----
+
. You should now have the example data that is used in the rest of this documentation.
