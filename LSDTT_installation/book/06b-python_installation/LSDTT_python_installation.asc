== Installing the LSDTopoTools python toolchain

*LSDTopoTools* is written in pass:[C++] but also includes a number of automation and visualisation rountines written in python. 

Because *LSDTopoTools* handles primarily spatial data, a number of python packages for handling spatial data are needed in the *LSDTopoTools* python toolchain. We have attempted to make setting up this toolchain as painless as possible using https://conda.io/miniconda.html[miniconda] and https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html[conda environments]. 

Please see the chapter on [LSDTopoTools visualisation] for instructions on how to [install the LSDTopoTools python toolchain].
