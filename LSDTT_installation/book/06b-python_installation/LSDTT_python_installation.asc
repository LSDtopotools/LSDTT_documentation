== Installing the LSDTopoTools python toolchain


*LSDTopoTools* is written in pass:[C++] but also includes a number of automation and visualisation rountines written in python. 

Because *LSDTopoTools* handles primarily spatial data, a number of python packages for handling spatial data are needed in the *LSDTopoTools* python toolchain. We have attempted to make setting up this toolchain as painless as possible using https://conda.io/miniconda.html[miniconda] and https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html[conda environments]. 

Please see the chapter on link:LSDTT_visualisation.html[LSDTopoTools visualisation] for instructions on how to link:LSDTT_visualisation.html#_installing_the_lsdtopotools_python_toolchain[install the LSDTopoTools python toolchain].

The preferred way to install *LSDTopoTools* is via a Docker container (see <<Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker,previous sections>>), but because our python tools use a large number of python packages we have a separate container for these tools.
