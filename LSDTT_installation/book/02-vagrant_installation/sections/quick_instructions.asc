.Quick instructions for starting a Vagrant server with LSDTopoTools
************************************************
. Download and install https://www.virtualbox.org/[virtualbox]. As of 01-Nov-2017 Vagrant does not work with VirtualBox 5.2. Make sure you download Virtualbox 5.1 instead: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1
. Download and install https://www.vagrantup.com/[vagrant]. As of 22-Dec-2017 Vagrant 2.0.1 has conflicts with some ruby packages. Make sure you download Vagrant 2.0.0: https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.0/ You might have to restart your computer after this. *You need to install virtualbox before you install vagrant, or you might get errors.*
. If you are on Windows, download http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html[putty.exe]. If you are on Linux or MacOS you can skip this because they have built-in equivalents.
. Make a directory for your vagrant box. We tend to put ours in a directory called `VagrantBoxes`.
. Inside that directory make two new directories: `LSDTopoTools` and `Ubuntu`. The second directory's name doesn't matter, it is just for holding a vagrant file (see below). However you **MUST** have the `LSDTopoTools` directory. The directory name is **case sensitive**!
. Download one of our vagrantfiles: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles into the `Ubuntu` directory (again, the name of the directory doesn't matter).
. Rename the vagrantfile from the repo (either `Vagrantfile_32bit_FFTW` or `Vagrantfile_64bit_FFTW`) simply `vagrantfile`. Your operating system is almost certainly 64 bit, but on most computers you need to select 32 bit because the default setting is to disable 64 bit guest operating systems. This can be changed but only by expert users.
. Open a terminal or powershell window and navigate to the directory with the vagrantfile.
. Run `vagrant up` from the command line.
+
WARNING: If you are running `vagrant up` for the first time it can take some time to download the https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/boxes.html[base box]. They are several hundred Mb each!
+
. Run `vagrant provision` after the box has started.
. If on Windows, you should now be able to use `putty.exe` to ssh into your LSDTopoTools server. The host name is almost always `127.0.0.1` and the port is almost always `2222`.
. On Windows, you will need to give a username and password after connecting using `putty.exe`. The machine is running locally on your computer so nothing is being sent over the internet. The username is always `vagrant`  and the password is also `vagrant`.
. If you are on MacOS or Linux you do not need `putty.exe`; all you need to do is type `vagrant ssh` into the command line. See the https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/up.html[vagrant instructions].

.Quick instructions for setting up directories in your vagrant box
************************************************
. Use `putty.exe` (in Windows) or `vagrant ssh` (on MacOS/Linux) to log into your vagrant server.
. Go to the *LSDTopoTools* directory by typing `cd /LSDTopoTools`
. Type `python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 0`
. You are ready to go for some basic analysis!
