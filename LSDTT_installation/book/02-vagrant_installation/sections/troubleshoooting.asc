=== Troubleshooting a vagrant server

There are a few common problems people have when running a vagrant server.

* If you are on an old computer, sometimes vagrant times out before the virtual machine boots. This most frequently happens the first time you boot a vagrant machine. The most effective way to fix this is with the canonical IT solution: turning it off and on again. To do that run `vagrant halt` and `vagrant up` in succession.
* If vagrant hangs up in the powershell or terminal window and does not give you back the command prompt, turn it off and on again by typing ctrl-c and then running the vagrant command again.
* If your files are not syncing across your host and vagrant machine, it is probably because there is some misspelling in your `LSDTopoTools` folder on the host machine. Make sure that folder is in the correct place and is spelled correctly (remember it should be case sensitive!!).
