There are a few common problems people have when running a vagrant server.

==== Vagrant up doesn't work

* The first time you run `vagrant up` you will need to be connected to the internet as you need to download the base box (which is ~700Mb).
* If you are on an old computer, sometimes vagrant times out before the virtual machine boots. This most frequently happens the first time you boot a vagrant machine. The most effective way to fix this is with the canonical IT solution: turning it off and on again. To do that run `vagrant halt` and `vagrant up` in succession.

==== I closed the window running vagrant: how do I shut it down?

* Open virtualbox: you will see the vagrant machine. Simply power it off (from within virtualbox).

==== Vagrant hangs up in powershel or terminal window

* If vagrant hangs up in the powershell or terminal window and does not give you back the command prompt, turn it off and on again by typing ctrl-c and then running the vagrant command again.

==== File syncing doesn't work

* If your files are not syncing across your host and vagrant machine, it is probably because there is some misspelling in your `LSDTopoTools` folder on the host machine. Make sure that folder is in the correct place and is spelled correctly (remember it should be case sensitive!!).
* This also has emerged because of a conflict with the latest *VirtualBox* versions. Make sure you have *VirtualBox* 5.1 *or lower*. As of December 2017 VirtualBox 5.2 doesn't work. 

==== I get some crazy conflict about Ruby when I run vagrant up

* This is an error associated with the latest Vagrant version. You need version 2.0.0 or lower. As of January 2018 Vagrant 2.0.1 doesn't work. 

==== I ran vagrant up. Now what?

* You need to log on to the vagrant machine with either *putty.exe* (Windows) or by typing `vagrant ssh` (Linux, MacOS) into the command line. See instructions for more details.
