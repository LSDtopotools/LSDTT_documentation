== Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant

Our most tested method uses two software packages, which are both free to download:

* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] is software for creating virtual machines, which are implementations of operating systems that live in your host operating system (e.g., you can have a virtual Linux system operating within your Windows or MacOS operating system).

IMPORTANT: As of 01-Nov-2017 Vagrant does not work with VirtualBox 5.2. Make sure you download Virtualbox 5.1 instead: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1

* https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] is software for managing and provisioning virtual machines.

IMPORTANT: As of 22-Dec-2017 Vagrant 2.0.1 has conflicts with some ruby packages. Make sure you download Vagrant 2.0.0: https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.0/
