== Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant

.Important note
***********************************
WARNING: Starting in October 2018, we have moved to link:LSDTT_installation.html#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_docker[Docker as the default installation method]. 
If you use MacOS, Linux, or Windows 10 Enterprise, we suggest you use Docker. Otherwise, you should use this installation method.

If you are on Windows 10 but cannot install docker, you can also try to install the <<Installing LSDTopoTools on the Windows Linux Subsytem,Windows Linux subsystem>>. 
***********************************


Our most tested method uses two software packages, which are both free to download:

* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] is software for creating virtual machines, which are implementations of operating systems that live in your host operating system (e.g., you can have a virtual Linux system operating within your Windows or MacOS operating system).

IMPORTANT: As of 01-Nov-2017 Vagrant does not work with VirtualBox 5.2. Make sure you download Virtualbox 5.1 instead: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1

* https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] is software for managing and provisioning virtual machines.

IMPORTANT: As of 22-Dec-2017 Vagrant 2.0.1 has conflicts with some ruby packages. Make sure you download Vagrant 2.0.0: https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.0/
