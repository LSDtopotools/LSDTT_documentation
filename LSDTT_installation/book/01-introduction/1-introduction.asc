== Introduction

Welcome to the installation instructions for http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*], which is a collection of programs for analysing topography and modelling hydrology, landscape evolution and soil development.

*LSDTopoTools* is built for Linux operating systems. Wait stop!! Where are you going? Come back!! We are going to get this to work on your computer, honest!

Most users will not use a Linux operating system as their day-to-day operating system; Windows and MacOS are much more popular. However, through the either virtualisation or containers you can build a Linux environment within any operating system. In fact, building either a virtual machine or a container has the advantage of ensuring that everyone using these systems has the same environment. This precludes the "works on my machine" problem that is common amongst scientific software packages.

In these documents you will find four flavours of *LSDTopoTools* installation instructions:

* Installation using https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] + https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]. This method is the most tested. You might consider this the default method.

* Installation using https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. This has fewer steps than the VirtualBox+Vagrant method. The Docker method and the VirtualBox method are not compatible on Windows machines (using Docker on Windows breaks VirtualBox). It only works on Windows 10 Enterprise and MacOS. If you have one of these systems you might consider Docker.

* Native installation on a Linux system. If your native operating system is Linux you can just install *LSDTopoTools* after getting all the libraries you need. The documents are made under the assumption that you use https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], but if you are a Linux user we are confident you'll be able to port the instructions to your native system (usually this involves replacing `sudo apt-get` with `sudo yum`).

* https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh] installation. This software is developed at the University of Edinburgh and is used in teaching. We include instructions specific for Edinburgh students for use on the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] servers.
