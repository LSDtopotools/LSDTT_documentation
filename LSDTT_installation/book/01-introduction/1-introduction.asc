== Introduction

Welcome to the installation instructions for http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*], which is a collection of programs for analysing topography and modelling hydrology, landscape evolution and soil development.

*LSDTopoTools* is built for Linux operating systems. Wait stop!! Where are you going? Come back!! We are going to get this to work on your computer, honest!

Most users will not use a Linux operating system as their day-to-day operating system; Windows and MacOS are much more popular. However, through the either virtualisation or containers you can build a Linux environment within any operating system. In fact, building either a virtual machine or a container has the advantage of ensuring that everyone using these systems has the same environment. This precludes the "works on my machine" problem that is common amongst scientific software packages.

In these documents you will find four flavours of *LSDTopoTools* installation instructions:

* Installation using https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. This works for MacOS and Linux well. It works for Windows 10 Enterprise edition. If you don't have those operating systems you will need to use https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] + https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] (see below).

* Native installation on a Linux system. If your native operating system is Linux you can just install *LSDTopoTools* after getting all the libraries you need. The documents are made under the assumption that you use https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], but if you are a Linux user we are confident you'll be able to port the instructions to your native system (usually this involves replacing `sudo apt-get` with `sudo yum`).

* https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh] installation. This software is developed at the University of Edinburgh and is used in teaching. We include instructions specific for Edinburgh students for use on the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] servers.

* Installation using https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] + https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]. This method is well tested but it requires two bits of software instead of one for https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker], and instead of a lightweight container you need a full blown https://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu] system as a virtual machine, meaning that this takes up more space on your hard disk. Also, on Windows machines, it is difficult to install a 64-bit guest operating system: you will probably be limited to a 32-bit system that limits your memory if you use this approach. So if you have MacOS, Linux, or Windows 10 Enterprise you should probably use the Docker installation.
