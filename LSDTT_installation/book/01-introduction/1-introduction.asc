== Introduction

Welcome to the installation instructions for http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*], which is a collection of programs for analysing topography and modelling hydrology, landscape evolution and soil development.

=== Components of LSDTopoTools

*LSDTopoTools* has several components. These can be used in isolation or together. 

* *LSDTopoTools* command line tools: these run the core computational components of *LSDTopoTools*. These do most of the heavy lifting of *LSDTopoTools*. 
* *lsdviztools* a series of python scripts for visualising *LSDTopoTools* outputs. You can run these interactively but they also come with command line scripts. 
* *lsdtopytools* a python wrapper for *LSDTopoTools* so you get much of the functionality of the *LSDTopoTools* command line tools within the python environment. 

=== Basic installation

If you are already familiar with Linux and/or Conda this should relatively painless. 

. If you are in a Linux or MacOS all you really need is Miniconda. You should use the python 3.8 version. 
.. https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macosx-installers[miniconda for MacOS]
.. https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers[miniconda for Linux]
. In windows don't install conda for windows! Create an Ubuntu subsystem https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[using these instructions] and install conda there. 
. Once you have conda you can install the command line tools like this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda -c conda-forge install lsdtopotools
----
. Now you can use the command line tools!


=== lsdtopotools Python tools

. You install *lsdtopytools* using conda
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda -c conda-forge install lsdtopytools
----
+
. You install *lsdviztools* using `pip`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ pip install lsdviztools
----
+
. These both have a bunch of dependencies so it is easier to use our docker container that has everything pre-installed. You can read about that below. 


=== Menu of more detailed instructions

* Installation using https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. This works for MacOS and Linux well. It works for Windows 10 Enterprise edition. If you don't have those operating systems you will need to use https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] + https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] (see below).

* Native installation on a Linux system. If your native operating system is Linux you can just install *LSDTopoTools* after getting all the libraries you need. The documents are made under the assumption that you use https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], but if you are a Linux user we are confident you'll be able to port the instructions to your native system (usually this involves replacing `sudo apt-get` with `sudo yum`).

* https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh] installation. This software is developed at the University of Edinburgh and is used in teaching. We include instructions specific to students and staff at the University of Edinburgh for use on the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] servers.


.What installation method should I use?
*****************************************************
* If you are in MacOS, Linux, we <<recommend Docker,Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker>>.
* If you have Windows 10 enterprise and administrator privilidges, we also <<recommend Docker,Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker>>. 
* If you want better performance you can try the <<Installing natively on a Linux system,native Linux installation>> (works on both Linux and MacOS since the latter is built on top of Linux).
* If you have Windows 10 but don't have the Enterprise edition or access priviledges, you can do a <<Installing LSDTopoTools using Windows Subsystem for Linux,"native" Linux installation using the Windows Linux Subsystem>>.
