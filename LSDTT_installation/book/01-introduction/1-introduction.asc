== Introduction

Welcome to the installation instructions for *LSDTopoTools*, which is a collection of programs for analysing topography and modelling hydrology, landscape evolution and soil development. 

*LSDTopoTools* is built for Linux operating systems. Most users will not use a Linux operating system as their day-to-day operating system; Windows and MacOS are much more popular. However, through the either virtualisation or containers you can build a Linux environment within any operating system. In fact, building either a virtual machine or a container has the advantage of ensuring that everyone useing these systems has the same environment. This precludes the "works on my machine" problem that is common amongst scientific software packages. 

In these documents you will find five flavours of *LSDTopoTools* installation instructions:

* Installation using VirtualBox+Vagrant. This method is the most tested. You might consider this the default method.

* Installation using Docker. This has fewer steps than the VirtualBox+Vagrant method. The Docker method and the VirtualBox method are not compatible on windows machines (using Docker on Windows breaks VirtualBox). It only works on Windows 10 Enterprise and MacOS. If you have one of these systems you might consider Docker.

* Native installation on a Linux system. If your native system is Linux you can just install *LSDTopoTools* after getting all the libraries you need. 

* University of Edinburgh installation. This software is developed at the University of Edinburgh and is used in teaching. We include instructions specific for Edinburgh students for use on the School of GeoSciences students.
