== Introduction

Welcome to the installation instructions for http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*], which is a collection of programs for analysing topography and modelling hydrology, landscape evolution and soil development.

=== The five typical ways to use LSDTopoTools 

There are five main ways you can use *LSDTopoTools*


[cols="3,3,3"]
|===
|Installation method |Advantages |Disadvantages

|If you don't want to install any software (or don't have privileges to do so) you can run *LSDTopoTools* in a web browser using https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb[google colab]. There are many examples here: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdtt_notebooks
|You don't need to install anything on your computer. All you need is a web browser. **This is the place to start if you are a new user!!**
|Takes ~30 seconds to spin up each time you start, every time you start. Unless you pay google, your storage will be limited (but the memory on google colab is quite good: 12Gb for the free version)

|Install locally on your computer using the the distribution package built by University of Edinburgh GeoScience IT team (specifically Nikolaos Dandoulakis). This works in a Linux environment so if you are in Windows or MacOS you will need to access the Linux subsystems (which is not that difficult these days).
|Get full performance of your memory and CPU. 
|You need to have the permission to install software on your computer

|Install locally on your computer using the package management software https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/[conda]. This works in a Linux environment so if you are in Windows or MacOS you will need to access the Linux subsystems (which is not that difficult these days).
|Get full performance of your memory and CPU. 
|You need to be familiar with conda or mamba. You need to maintain the various packages yourself. 

|Run within the https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker[lsdtt docker container]. To do this you need to install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[docker] first, but as of 2021 this is quite easy, even on Windows.
|After you install docker, this just starts right out of the box. Easier than installing locally. Python stack certain to work. 
|You won't get full power of your CPU or memory (because Docker runs in parallel with your host computer).

|You could also compile *LSDTopoTools* from its source code. 
|Not really faster than the conda installation but if you have some weird version of Linux this will work if conda fails. But you need to know what you are doing in Linux. 
|Takes a long time and you need to edit you $PATH. This option is really only for developers.)

=== Components of LSDTopoTools

*LSDTopoTools* has several components. These can be used in isolation or together. Both *LSDTopoTools* and *lsdtopytools* can be installed using https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[conda]. *lsdviztools* can be installed using https://pypi.org/project/lsdviztools/[pip].

* *LSDTopoTools* command line tools: these run the core computational components of *LSDTopoTools*. These do most of the heavy lifting of *LSDTopoTools*.
* *lsdviztools* a series of python scripts for visualising *LSDTopoTools* outputs. You can run these interactively but they also come with command line scripts. 
* *lsdtopytools* a python wrapper for *LSDTopoTools* so you get much of the functionality of the *LSDTopoTools* command line tools within the python environment. 

=== Basic local installation: debian installer version

. In a terminal window do this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://pkgs.geos.ed.ac.uk/geos-jammy/pool/world/l/lsdtopotools2/lsdtopotools2_0.9-1geos~22.04.1_amd64.deb
$ apt install ./lsdtopotools2_0.9-1geos~22.04.1_amd64.deb
----
+
. Congratualtions, you are done.

=== Basic local installation

If you are already familiar with Linux and/or Conda this should relatively painless. 

. If you are in a Linux or MacOS all you really need is https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[Miniconda]. 
.. https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#macosx-installers[miniconda for MacOS]
.. https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers[miniconda for Linux]
. In windows don't install conda for windows! Create an Ubuntu subsystem https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[using these instructions] and install conda there. 
. Once you have conda you can install the command line tools like this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda -c conda-forge install lsdtopotools
----
. Now you can use the command line tools!


=== lsdtopotools Python tools

. You install *lsdtopytools* using conda
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda -c conda-forge install lsdtopytools
----
+
. You install *lsdviztools* using `pip`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ pip install lsdviztools
----
+
. Both *lsdtopytools* and *lsdviztools* have a bunch of dependencies so it is easier to use our docker container that has everything pre-installed. You can read about that below. *lsdtopotools* command line tools have minimal dependencies by design (but do not work in Windows, so you need to have a linux environment, such as https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[windows subsytem for linux]). 


=== Menu of more detailed instructions

* Installation using https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. This works for MacOS and Linux well. It works for Windows 10 Enterprise edition. If you don't have those operating systems you will need to use https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] + https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] (see below).

* Native installation on a Linux system. If your native operating system is Linux you can just install *LSDTopoTools* after getting all the libraries you need. The documents are made under the assumption that you use https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu], but if you are a Linux user we are confident you'll be able to port the instructions to your native system (usually this involves replacing `sudo apt-get` with `sudo yum`).

* https://www.ed.ac.uk/[University of Edinburgh] installation. This software is developed at the University of Edinburgh and is used in teaching. As it turns out you don't really need to install the software if you are at Edinburgh since it is already installed on the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[School of GeoSciences] servers and on the https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/noteable/accessing-noteable[Notable] service.


.What installation method should I use?
*****************************************************
* If you are in MacOS or Linux you can use the conda installation. You can also use the <<Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker,Docker installation>>.
* If you have Windows 10+ and administrator privileges, we <<Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker,recommend Docker>>. 
* If you want better performance you can try the <<Installing natively on a Linux system,native Linux installation>> (works on both Linux and MacOS since the latter is built on top of Linux).
* If you can't do any of the above just use *LSDTopoTools* on https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdtt_notebooks/blob/master/lsdtopotools/lsdtopotools_on_colab.ipynb[google colab].
