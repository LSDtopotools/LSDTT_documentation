== Installing natively on a Linux system

Our software is designed for linux operating systems but we do recommend you use either our <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant,VirtualBox+Vagrant setup>> or our <<Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker,Docker setup>> because in those two cases you will be using the same environment as the developers so it will be easier to answer questions when you have problems. However, if you just want *LSDTopoTools* on your Linux machine, follow these steps:

. Start a terminal session.
. Install some essential softare (we will use Ubuntu installation, you need to modify these if you are on another version of Linux). This assumes you have the GNU pass:[c++] tools:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y git
$ sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin
$ sudo apt-get install -y python-gdal
$ sudo apt-get install -y libfftw3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install -y cmake
----
+
. Go the the directory where you want to install *LSDTopoTools*.
. Download our setup script.
+
[source]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
. Run the setup tool:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 1
----
+
NOTE: The `-id` flag tells LSDTopoToolsSetup.py where to put the files. In vagrant it always starts in the root directory (this is for file syncing purposes). However, if your native operating system is Linux, then you can either install in your home directory (`-id 0`) or in the directory where you called LSDTopoToolsSetup.py (`-id 1`).
+
. If `wget` doesn't work, you can follow the link:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py +
Copy the text, paste it into a text editor and save it as `LSDTopoToolsSetup.py`.
+
. The `LSDTopoToolsSetup.py` tool has a number of options: if you want a preview of what it does, you can call its help options:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -h
