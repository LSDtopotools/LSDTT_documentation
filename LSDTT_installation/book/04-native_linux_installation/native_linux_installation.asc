== Installing natively on a Linux system

Our software is designed for linux operating systems but we do recommend you use either our <<Installing LSDTopoTools using VirtualBox and Vagrant,VirtualBox+Vagrant setup>> or our <<Installing LSDTopoTools using Docker,Docker setup>> because in those two cases you will be using the same environment as the developers so it will be easier to answer questions when you have problems. However, if you just want *LSDTopoTools* on your Linux machine, follow these steps:

=== Get the associated software you need

. Start a terminal session.
. Install some essential softare (we will use Ubuntu installation, you need to modify these if you are on another version of Linux). This assumes you have the GNU pass:[c++] tools:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y git
$ sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin
$ sudo apt-get install -y python-gdal
$ sudo apt-get install -y libfftw3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install -y cmake
----

=== Get the LSDTopoTools2 code and install


. You probably should make a directory where you keep everything associated with *LSDTopoTools*. A suggested name for this directory is *LSDTopoTools*: it says what it does on the tin. Go into that directory once you have created it.  

. Next, clone the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2[*LSDTopoTools2* repository] here:
+
[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2.git
----
+
. Go into that new directory:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd LSDTopoTools2
----
+
. Run the setup tool
+
[source,console]
----
$ sh lsdtt2_setup.sh
----
+
. You can now navigate to your data and start using *LSDTopoTools*. See link:LSDTT_basic_usage.html[our section on first analyses in *LSDTopoTools*].

=== Starting an LSDTopoTools2 session after your first installation

* Whenever you return to run an LSDTopoTools2 session, you will need to tell the computer where your program files are. You cave two options:
** Run `sh lsdtt2_setup.sh` in the LSDTopoTools2 directory. This gets the latest version of the software, recompiles, and points your session to the program files. 
** Run `sh lsdtt2_terminal.sh` in the LSDTopoTools2 directory. This just points your session to the program files.
* You must do one of those two things otherwise your computer will not know where the program files are. 
* As an alternative, you can go into yor `.bashrc` file and add the `/path/to/LSDTopoTools2/bin` directory to your `$PATH`. You will need to change the full path to reflect your own directory system. If you don't know what a `.bashrc` file is you are probably better off running the `lsdtt2_terminal.sh` script.
