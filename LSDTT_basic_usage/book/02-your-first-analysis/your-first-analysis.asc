== Basic analyses in LSDTopoTools using the lsdtt-basic-metrics program

This chapter will walk you through some basic topographic analysis using our program *lsdtt-basic-metrics*. This program can extract topographic metrics like slope, aspect and curvature. Alongside these metrics it can also extract channel networks, and get drainage areas. The program is intended for everyday data processing. A number of these operations are available in GIS software, but we tend to prefer *LSDTopoTools* because:

* The slope and curvature metrics in typical GIS software only uses information from the nearest pixels. We fit a polynomial surface from a neighbourhood of pixels. See http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JF002057/abstract[Hurst et al., 2012, DOI: 10.1029/2011JF002057] and https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/4/627/2016/[Grieve et al., 2016, doi:10.5194/esurf-4-627-2016] for the rationale.
* Our channel extractions for the d8 method are based on the http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X12004618[FASTSCAPE] algorithm and are *MUCH* faster than running channel extraction in typical GIS software.
* The program does some data preprocessing behind the scenes that you would need to do manually in a GIS.
* We have automated some basin selection routines, which again you would need to do by hand in a GIS.
* Our channel extraction spits out networks with drainage areas, locations, chi coordinates and all sorts of other goodies that again, would take ages on a GIS.


The examples in this section are used for both *LSDTopoTools* workshops as well as in the http://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[University of Edinburgh] course, http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxgegr10094.htm[Eroding Landscapes].

=== Summary

You now have seen the basic interface of http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] programs, got a small taste of Linux, and know a few things about QGIS. From here you should be able to move on to more advanced topographic analysis.
