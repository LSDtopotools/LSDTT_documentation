== An example using data from LSDTopoTools

This chapter gives and example of computing some basic raster and csv data from http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] and then importing it into QGIS. We use these examples in of one the practical exercises in the http://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[University of Edinburgh] course, http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxgegr10094.htm[Eroding Landscapes].

One of the objectives of this exercise is to get you familiar with moving between a linux environment and QGIS, which you can read about link:LSDTT_QGIS.html[in our QGIS documentation]

=== Summary

You now have seen the basic interface of http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] programs, got a small taste of Linux, and know a few things about QGIS. From here you should be able to move on to more advanced topographic analysis.
