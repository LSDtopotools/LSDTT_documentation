.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below. 

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]

In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].
*********************************************

== Your first analysis using LSDTopoTools

We are going to run an *LSDTopoTools* program that is used for basic topographic analysis. 

=== Download and run the setup tool

. First open a terminal window. This will be in either a vagrant server, a docker container, an NX window or your native linux system, depending on how you link:LSDTT_installation.html[installed *LSDTopoTools*]. Once you are in a terminal window, you will see some text and then a `$` symbol which tells you that the linux machine is waiting for a command. Type your commands after this symbol (in docker this might be a `#` symbol).

. We are going to download a python script into your home directory. The `cd ~` command gets you to your home diretory in linux. Go there and then download a file using `wget`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
. Now we run the setup tool. Doing this will trigger a bunch of stuff that will take a few minutes. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 0
----
+ 
. If you are on a native linux machine or Edinburgh servers, this will install *LSDTopoTools* in your home directory. In docker or vagrant it will install in the root directory (`/`). 

=== Run a basic analysis

. We need two terminal windows open. You already have one open, so open another one.
. In the first terminal do the following:
.. In docker or vagrant:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
----
+
.. In a native linux or on Edinburgh's servers type:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
----
+
. We will explain all this stuff in ore detail later, for now just execute the commnands. 
. Now in the other terminal window type:
.. For vagrant/docker:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
----
+
.. For native linux/Edinburgh:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
----
+
. UPDATE WITH PYTHON SCRIPT FOR MODIFYING FILENAMES
. Okay, now go back to the first terminal window. Type the following:
.. For docker/vagrant
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/ WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
.. For native Linux/Edinburgh servers
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out ~/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/ WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
