=== Draniage area and channel extraction

Finally, we will compute some drainage areas and extract a channel network. To do this run the *driver file* `WA_BasicMetrics03.driver`. 

. Run the program using:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/ WA_BasicMetrics03.driver
----
+
*OR*
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/ WA_BasicMetrics03.driver
----
+
I am going to let you figure out which one to use...you will need to work this out on your own at some point. 
+
. Yet more stuff will come out. Some are drainage area rasters, but there is also a `csv` file, `WA_ThirdExample_CN.csv`.
+
. You will get a file with point, which you can load into QGIS. You can read about how to do that link:LSDTT_QGIS.html#_import_point_data_from_text_or_spreadsheet[in our QGIS instructions]. You will get something that looks a bit like this:

==== Questions for channel extraction. 

* Try changing the `threshold_contributing_pixels` parameter. What happens to the channel network? 
* More advanced: You can get a smoothed elevation raster with the following *driver file* line: `print_smoothed_elevation: true`. Try creating a smoothed elevation raster and then using this smoothed raster for the drainage extraction. You will need to change the `read fname:` parameter to reflect the smoothed raster.
