=== Draniage area and channel extraction

Finally, we will compute some drainage areas and extract a channel network. To do this run the *driver file* `WA_BasicMetrics03.driver`. 

. First modify the directories in `WA_BasicMetrics03.driver`.
. Run the program:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /home/smudd/courses/Eroding_landscapes/2017/practicals/practical_02 WA_BasicMetrics03.driver
----
+
. Yet more stuff will come out. Some are drainage area rasters, but there is also a `csv` file, `WA_ThirdExample_CN.csv`.
+
. To load this in QGIS, follow the instructions here: <<Import point data from text or spreadsheet>>. You will get something that looks a bit like this:

==== Questions for channel extraction. 

* Try changing the `threshold_contributing_pixels` parameter. What happens to the channel network. 
* More advanced: You can get a smoothed elevation raster with the following *driver file* line: `print_smoothed_elevation: true`. Try creating a smoothed elevation raster and then using this smoothed raster for the drainage extraction. You will need to change the `read fname:` parameter to reflect the smoothed raster.
