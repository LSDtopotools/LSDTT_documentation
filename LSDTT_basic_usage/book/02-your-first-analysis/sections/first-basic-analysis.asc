=== Your first analysis using LSDTopoTools

We are going to run an *LSDTopoTools2* program that is used for basic topographic analysis. If you have installed the programs already you just need to make sure that they are in your path. See the installation instructions. 

.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below.

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]

In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].
*********************************************

==== Get the test data

If you have followed the link:LSDTT_installation.html[installation instructions] and grabbed the example data, you already have what you need! If not, follow the steps below:

. If you are using a docker container, just run the script:
+
[source,console]
----
# Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
. If you are on a native linux or using the University of Edinburgh servers, do the following:
.. If you have installed *LSDTopoTools*, you will have a directory somewhere called `LSDTopoTools`. Go into it. 
.. Run the following commands (you only need to do this once):
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ mv ./ExampleTopoDatasets-master ./ExampleTopoDatasets
$ rm master.zip
----
+
.. WARNING: This downloads a bit over 150Mb of data so make sure you have room. 



==== Run an analysis

. Go into the directory with this data: `cd ExampleTopoDatasets/BasicMetricsData`.
. If you have installed `LSDTopoTools` correctly, you should just be able to call `lsdtt-basic-metrics`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ lsdtt-basic-metrics WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
. This will spit out some information to you screen. It will also make a hillshade of the DEM, which is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`. 

==== Look at the data

. You can look at this raster in http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]. We have some link:LSDTT_QGIS.html[instructions for QGIS], if you want to see instructions for link:LSDTT_QGIS.html#_adding_data[adding data click here].
+
. Open QGIS and load the raster. The new raster is in the same directory with your other data and is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`.The data will look like this:
+
.A hillshade of the Whiteadder catchement
image::images/WA_HS.jpg[Whiteadder hillshade]
+
. As you can see, the DEM has quite a few artefacts. There isn't much we can do about that, I'm afraid.
