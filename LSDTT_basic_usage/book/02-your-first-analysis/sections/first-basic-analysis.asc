=== Your first analysis using LSDTopoTools

We are going to run an *LSDTopoTools2* program that is used for basic topographic analysis. If you have installed the programs already you just need to make sure that they are in your path. See the installation instructions. 

.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below.

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]

In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].
*********************************************

==== Get the test data

. If you have installed *LSDTopoTools*, you will have a directory somewhere called `LSDTopoTools`.
. Go into this directory enter the following:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data.git
----
+
. This will download the test data. 

==== Run an analysis

. Go into the directory with this data: `cd LSDTT_workshop_data`.
. If you have installed `LSDTopoTools` correctly, you should just be able to call `lsdtt-basic-metrics`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ lsdtt-basic-metrics WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
. This will spit out some information to you screen. It will also make a hillshade of the DEM, which is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`. 

==== Look at the data

. You can look at this raster in http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]. We have some link:LSDTT_QGIS.html[instructions for QGIS], if you want to see instructions for link:LSDTT_QGIS.html#_adding_data[adding data click here].
+
. Open QGIS and load the raster. The new raster is in the same directory with your other data and is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`.The data will look like this:
+
.A hillshade of the Whiteadder catchement
image::images/WA_HS.jpg[Whiteadder hillshade]
+
. As you can see, the DEM has quite a few artefacts. There isn't much we can do about that, I'm afraid.
