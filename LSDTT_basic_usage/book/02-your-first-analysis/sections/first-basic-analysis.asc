.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below.

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]

In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].
*********************************************

=== Your first analysis using LSDTopoTools

We are going to run an *LSDTopoTools* program that is used for basic topographic analysis.

==== Download and run the setup tool

. You need to open a terminal or shell window. If you don't know what this is link:LSDTT_installation.html[read the installation instructions].
. First open a terminal window. This will be in either a vagrant server, a docker container, an NX window or your native linux system, depending on how you link:LSDTT_installation.html[installed *LSDTopoTools*]. Once you are in a terminal window, you will see some text and then a `$` symbol which tells you that the linux machine is waiting for a command. Type your commands after this symbol (in docker this might be a `#` symbol).
+
. We are going to download a python script into your home directory. The `cd ~` command gets you to your home diretory in linux. Go there and then download a file using `wget`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
NOTE: Make sure the `wget` call (with the web address) is all on one line.
+
. Now we run the setup tool. Doing this will trigger a bunch of stuff that will take a few minutes. You could waste some time https://twitter.com/David_Rudnick/status/923196115910119424[on the internet].
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 0
----
+
. If you are on a native linux machine or Edinburgh servers, this will install *LSDTopoTools* in your home directory. In docker or vagrant it will install in the root directory (`/`).

==== Run a basic analysis

. We need two terminal windows open. You already have one open, so open another one. I will colour note the terminal ([red]#Terminal 1# or [blue]#Terminal 2#) in each step
. [red]#Terminal 1# In the first terminal do the following:
.. [red]#Terminal 1# In docker or vagrant:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
----
+
.. [red]#Terminal 1# In native linux or on Edinburgh's servers type:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
----
+
. [red]#Terminal 1# We will explain all this stuff in more detail later, for now just execute the commands.
. [blue]#Terminal 2# Now in the other terminal window type:
.. For vagrant/docker:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
----
+
.. For native linux/Edinburgh:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
----
+
. [blue]#Terminal 2# We want to update the path names. So get the path updater script and run it:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTTParamfileUpdater.py
$ python LSDTTParamfileUpdater.py
----
+
. [red]#Terminal 1# Okay, now go back to the first terminal window. Type the following:
.. For docker/vagrant
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/ WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
.. For native Linux/Edinburgh servers
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out ~/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/ WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
. [red]#Terminal 1# If you had all the directory names correct, you will get some text to screen that ends with a statement about hillshading. In fact all this does is print a hillshade of the raster.
+
. You can look at this raster in http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]. We have some link:LSDTT_QGIS.html[instructions for QGIS], if you want to see instructions for link:LSDTT_QGIS.html#_adding_data[adding data click here].
+
. Open QGIS and load the raster. The new raster is in the same directory with your other data and is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`.The data will look like this:
+
.A hillshade of the Whiteadder catchement
image::images/WA_HS.jpg[Whiteadder hillshade]
+
. As you can see, the DEM has quite a few artefacts. There isn't much we can do about that, I'm afraid.
