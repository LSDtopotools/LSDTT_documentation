== Introduction and overview

This document takes you through an inital *LSDTopoTools* analysis. Through the tutorials contained here we will demonstrate how our analysis programs run: they all share a common interface. 

.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below. 

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]

In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].

=== The basic structure of an analysis

Our analyses are packaged into separate programs. They are run from the Linux shell. All of our programs operate the same way:

* You keep the program and the data in two different directories. 
* The directory with the data also has a parameter file, which contains instructions for the program. 
* You have to tell the program where the data directory is, as well as the name of the parameter file. You do this from the command line. 

The basic structure looks like this:

.All *LSDTopoTools* analyses work like this.

==== Running a typical analysis

In the next section we will walk you though an analysis. But reading this will help you understand where you are going. 

* We usually keep two terminal windows open. 
** The first one is in the directory with the program. We call the program from here.  
** The second one is in the directory with the data. The main reasen we keep this open is to use the `pwd` command to copy the directory name into the first terminal window. 
* In the first window you call the program. It will look like this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./An_LSDTT_program.exe /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/A_project AParameterFile.param
----
+
* The program name (`./An_LSDTT_program.exe`), the directory name (`/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/A_project`) and the paremeter file name (`AParameterFile.param`) will change but all *LSDTopoTools calls follow this same basic structure. 
* Now, all parameter files have these basic elements in them:
+
[source,paramfile]
----
read path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/A_project
write path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/A_project
read fname: Data_prefix
write fname: Data_prefix
----
+
*You need to change the path and fnames to reflect your data!*. 

==== How do I change my parameter files?

Just edit your paramter files in a text editor. This is just a program that edits plain text. *DO NOT* use a word processor. These modify file types. There are many options for text editors but we like http://brackets.io/[Brackets]. https://atom.io/[Atom] is also a nice alternative. 

However, editing the paths can be a bit annoying if you are moving data from place to place, so we have a python script, called `LSDTTParamfileUpdater.py` that updates the paths in the parameter file for you. The way you run that is:

. Download the script into your data folder (i.e. in the second terminal window you have open above):
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTTParamfileUpdater.py
----
+
. Run the file
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTTParamfileUpdater.py
----
+
. Once you've done this you are ready to call the program!
