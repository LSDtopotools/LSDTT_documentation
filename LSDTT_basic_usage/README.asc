== Building this documentation

This documentation has been written in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] format, using the extended functionality of http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]. http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Asciidoc] is similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[markdown] but we at *LSDTopoTools* like the added features of http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] and http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]. 

. To build the documentation you need to install http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor], which is built in https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[ruby].
. We highly recommend installing ruby using https://rvm.io/[rvm], which manages ruby versions. 
. It is much easier to install https://rvm.io/[rvm][rvm] on Linux operating systems than the alternatives. So if you are on another operating system you should consider creating a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization[container] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine[virtual machine] for Linux. 
. We explain how to install the correct version of Ruby and Asciidoctor here: https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_building_documentation.html

== Once you have Asciidoctor installed

=== Building this section only

. Once you have installed Asciidoctor (see link to instructions above), you first need to use [bundler] to install the required [gems]. In your ruby environment, from this directory, run:
+
[source,console]
----
$ bundle install
----
+
. Now rundle
+
[source,console]
----
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----
+
to just build the html files or 
+
[source,console]
----
$ bundle exec rake book:build
----
+
to include the pdf. 
+
. The html (and optional pdf) files will be written to the current directory. 


=== Building all the documentation

. If you want to build all the documentation at once and have it appear in the `html_build` directory you need to first go to the parent directory of the section, which has the python script https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_documentation/blob/master/compile_LSDTTDocs.py[`compile_LSDTTDocs.py`]. 
. Run this python script:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python compile_LSDTTDocs.py
----
+
. The html files for all the documentation will now appear in the `html_build` section.
