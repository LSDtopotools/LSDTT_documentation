== Some comments on open data and reproducibility

What seperates science from philosophy and art? Philosophers like Popper have argued that a defining feature of science is the ability to falsify hypotheses. Scientists need a way to know if a hypothesis is wrong. Other scientists must be able to test the findings. In scientific publications if other scientists cannot test the results, then the paper is more of an advertisement than actual science (in the succinct words of one of our Hutton Club speakers). Testability and reproducibility is the aspiration but in reality very few scientific papers are reproducible. This has been at times described as a "crisis" in science. On the LSDTopoTools team, we aspire for our publications to be fully reproducible. We admit to not fully reaching this goal in many cases: it poses technological barriers when you are processing many, many, gigabytes of data and requires carefully thought out workflows to maintain reproducibility. Each publication we make results in a slightly more streamlined workflow for reproducibility. Hopefully our experience can help others in creating reproducible research since we have learned many lessons about the best way to create fully reproducible analyses the hard way.   

== The philosophy behind LSDTopoTools

http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] is a software package designed to analyze landscapes for applications in geomorphology, hydrology, ecology and allied fields. 
It is not intended as a substitute for a GIS, but rather is designed to be a research and analysis tool that produces **reproducible** data. 
The motivations behind its development were:

. To serve as a framework for implementing the latest developments in topographic analysis.
. To serve as a framework for developing new topographic analysis techniques.
. To serve as a framework for numerical modelling of landscapes (for hydrology, geomorphology and ecology).
. To improve the *speed* and *performance* of topographic analysis versus other tools (e.g., commercial GIS software).
. To enable **reproducible** topographic analysis in the research context.

The toolbox is organized around objects, which are used to store and manipulate specific kinds of data,
and driver functions, which users write to interface with the objects.

************************************************
The http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~s0675405/LSD_Docs/index.html[Source code documentation site]
tells you all about the objects: these pages get into the nitty gritty of the computational algorithms
and I only recommend looking at them if you plan on developing the code.

WARNING: This page is slightly out of date since Stuart, the owner of the website has moved to a different university. We will update this with a more stable website at some point.

For most readers of this documentation,
you can exist in blissful ignorance of the implementation and simply stay on these pages to learn how to use the software for your topographic analysis needs.

== Why don't we just use ArcMap/QGIS? It has topographic analysis tools.

One of the things our group does as geomorphologists is try to understand the physics and evolution of the Earth's surface by analyzing topography.
Many geomorphologists will take some topographic data and perform a large number of steps to produce and original analysis.
Our code is designed to automate such steps as well as make these steps reproducible.
If you send another geomorphologist your code and data they should be able to exactly reproduce your analysis.
This is not true of work done in ArcMap or other GIS systems. ArcMap and QGIS are good at many things! 
But they are not that great for analysis that can easily be reproduced by other groups. 
Our software was built to do the following:

. **LSDTopoTools** automates things that would be slow in ArcMap or QGIS.
. **LSDTopoTools** is designed to be *reproducible*: it does not depend on one individuals mouse clicks.
. **LSDTopoTools** uses the latest fast algorithms so it is much faster than ArcMap or QGIS for many things (for example, flow routing).
. **LSDTopoTools** has topographic analysis algorithms designed and coded by us or designed by someone else but coded by us soon after publication that are not available in ArcMap or QGIS.
. **LSDTopoTools** contains some elements of landscape evolution models which cannot be done in ArcMap or QGIS.
