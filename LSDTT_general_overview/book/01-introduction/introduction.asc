== Introduction

*LSDTopoTools* is software for analysing landscapes. It has applications in hydrology, ecology, soil science, and geomorphology. This document is not about the use of the software, but rather about its history and its philosophy. Your authors feel the need to write these things down because:

. Readers might wonder why we don't use existing software and
. We feel very strongly about open science and this is a chance to proselytize.

Firstly, we should tell you that LSD stands for _Land Surface Dynamics_,
and is named after http://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/research/research-institutes/global-change/land-surface[Land Surface Dynamics research cluster]
in the http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/[School of GeoSciences] at the http://www.ed.ac.uk/home[University of Edinburgh].

== A brief history (by Simon Mudd)

The project started around 2010 due to my increasing frustration with my inability to reproduce topographic analyses that I found in scientific papers and saw at conferences.
Some of the papers that had irreproducible analyses were my own!
Like many scientists working with topographic data, I was using a geographic information system (GIS) to prepare figures and analyse topography,
and after a long session of clicking on commercial software to get just that right figure,
I did not have a record of the steps I took to get there. *Mea culpa*.
However, I do not think I am the only person guilty of doing this!
I wanted a way of doing topographic analysis that did not involve a sequence of mouse clicks.

A second motivation came when my PhD student, http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/martinhurst/[Martin Hurst],
finished his PhD and left Edinburgh for warmer pastures in England (he is now back in Scotland, where he belongs).
His PhD included several novel analyses that were

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrf.20049/full[very]
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6148/868.short[useful],
but also built using the python functionality in a certain commercial GIS and not very portable.
I and my other PhD students wanted to run Martin's analyses on other landscapes,
but this proved to be a painful process that required numerous emails and telephone calls between Martin and our group.

This motivated me to start writing my own software for dealing with topographic data.
This seemed crazy at the time. Why were we trying to reinvent a GIS?
The answer is that the resulting software, https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools],
*IS NOT A GIS*! It is a series of algorithms that are open-source and can be used to analyse topography,
and the programs that run these analyses, which we call driver programs,
are intended to be redistributed such that if you have the same topographic data as was used in the original analysis,
you should be able to reproduce the analysis *exactly*.
In addition the philosophy of my research group is that each of our publications will coincide with the release of the software used to generate the figures: we made the (often frightening) decision that there would be no hiding behind cherry-picked figures.
(Of course, our figures in our papers are chosen to be good illustrations of some landscape property,
but other researchers can always use our code to find the ugly examples as well).

We hope that others outside our group will find our tools useful, and this document will help users get our tools working on their systems.
I do plead for patience: we have yet to involve anyone in the project that has any formal training in computer science or software engineering!
But we do hope to distribute beyond the walls of the http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/[School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh],
so please contact us for help, questions or suggestions.
