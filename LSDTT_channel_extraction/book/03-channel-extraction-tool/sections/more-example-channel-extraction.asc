=== More complex channel extraction

. We are staying at Indian Creek. However, this time you will run the second parameter file:
+
[source,console]
----
# lsdtt-channel-extraction IndianCreek_example02.param
----
+
WARNING: This takes a lot longer than the threshold area method!
+
. The parameter file looks like this
+
[source,paramfile]
----
# These are parameters for the file i/o
read fname: indian_creek
channel heads fname: NULL

# Parameter for filling the DEM
min_slope_for_fill: 0.0001

# Parameters for selecting channels and basins
threshold_contributing_pixels: 1000
connected_components_threshold: 100
print_area_threshold_channels: false
print_wiener_channels: true
print_pelletier_channels: true
print_dreich_channels: true
----
+
. This will calcualte the channel network and sources from three different methods:
.. Wiener
.. Driech
.. Pelletier
+
. You will get both `sources` and `CN` files for each of these methods

The figures below show the extracted channel network for the Indian Creek for the three different methods.
