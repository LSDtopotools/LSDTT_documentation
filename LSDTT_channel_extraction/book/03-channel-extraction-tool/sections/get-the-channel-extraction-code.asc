=== Starting up LSDTopoTools and getting the channel extraction tool

. The channel extraction tool (`lsdtt-channel-extraction`) is included in *LSDTOpoTools*, so if you have installed *LSDTopoTools* you will aready have what you need. 
.. If you haven't installed *LSDTopoTools*, follow the link:LSDTT_installation[LSDTopoTools installation instructions]).
. Before you do anything, you need to start an *LSDTopoTools* session. 
.. If you are using Docker , start the container:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -it -v C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pcl_docker
----
+
.. Then run the start script.
+
[source,console]
----
# Start_LSDTT.sh
----
+
. If you haven't got the example data yet, run:
+
[source,console]
----
# Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
+
. If you are using native linux, read the link:LSDTT_installation[LSDTopoTools installation instructions]. 


Like most of *LSDTopoTools*, you run this program by directing it to a parameter file. The parameter file has a series of keywords. Our convention is to place the parameter file in the same directory as your data.



=== Running a typical lsdtt-channel-extraction analysis

In the next section we will walk you though an analysis. However, reading this will help you understand where you are going, so we recommend you read the whole thing!

* You run the program from a terminal window
* You can supply the program with:
** a directory name
** a parameter file name
** both of these things
** none of these things 
* If you don't supply a parameter filename, the program will assume the parameter file is called `LSDTT_parameters.driver`
* If the parameter file doesn't exist, you will get an error message. 
+
Any of the following calls to one of the programs will work, as long as your files are in the right place:
+
[source,console]
----
$ lsdtt-channel-extraction 
$ lsdtt-channel-extraction /LSDTopoTools/data/A_project
$ lsdtt-channel-extraction AParameterFile.param
$ lsdtt-channel-extraction /LSDTopoTools/data/A_project AParameterFile.param
----
+
* The program name (`lsdtt-channel-extraction`), the directory name (`/LSDTopoTools/data/A_project`) and the parameter file name (`AParameterFile.param`) will change but all *LSDTopoTools* calls follow this same basic structure.
