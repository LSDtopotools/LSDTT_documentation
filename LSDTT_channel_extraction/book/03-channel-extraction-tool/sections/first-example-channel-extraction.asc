=== First Example of channel extraction. 

. We are going to extract a channel networks from Indian Creek, a small creek in Ohio. It was using in the study https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013WR015167[Clubb et al., 2014].
. Once you have run `Start_LSDTT.sh` you are ready to run an analysis. 
. Go into the directory containing the Indian Creek DEM. In the Docker container it is here:
+
[source,console]
----
# cd /LSDTopoTools/data/ExampleTopoDatasets/ChannelExtractionData/IndianCreek_1m
----
+
. Now run the channel extraction code:
+
[source,console]
----
# lsdtt-channel-extraction IndianCreek_example01.param
----
+
. The parameter file looks like this
+
[source,paramfile]
----
# These are parameters for the file i/o
read fname: indian_creek
channel heads fname: NULL

# Parameter for filling the DEM
min_slope_for_fill: 0.0001

# Parameters for selecting channels and basins
threshold_contributing_pixels: 1000
print_area_threshold_channels: true

write_hillshade: true
----
+
. This will generate a very basic channel network where channels begin where the contributung pixels are greater than the parameter `threshold_contributing_pixels`. 
. If you set a channel extraction method to true (in this example, `print_area_threshold_channels: true`), you will get two files: 
.. A file with the extension `sources.csv`: This has the location of the source pixels. We describe the file format below.
.. A file with the extension `CN.scv`: This contains the channel network, alog with the strahler order of the channels.
+
. In addition, we set `write_hillshade: true`, so we also get a hillshare raster, denoted by the `HS` in the filename.
+
. The channel networks and sources are in csv format, which foes not retain georeferencing information. That means, when you load it into a GIS, you will need to tell the link:LSDTT_QGIS.html#_another_special_case_csv_data_from_lsdtopotools
[GIS what projection you are using].
. If you want a file that can be directly read into a GIS, then use the parameter `convert_csv_to_geojson: true`
