=== First Example of channel extraction. 

. We are going to extract a channel networks from Indian Creek, a small creek in Ohio. It was using in the study https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013WR015167[Clubb et al., 2014].
. Once you have run `Start_LSDTT.sh` you are ready to run an analysis. 
. Go into the directory containing the Indian Creek DEM. In the Docker container it is here:
+
[source,console]
----
# cd /LSDTopoTools/data/ExampleTopoDatasets/ChannelExtractionData/IndianCreek_1m
----
+
. Now run the channel extraction code:
+
[source,console]
----
# lsdtt-channel-extraction IndianCreek_example01.param
----
+
. You will get several extracted channel networks from differnt methods.
