== The Channel Extraction tool

Our channel extraction tool bundles four methods of channel extraction. These are:

* A rudimentary extraction using a drainage area threshold.
* The http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013WR015167/abstract[Dreich method (Clubb et al., 2014)].
* The http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012WR012452/abstract[Pelletier (2013) method].
* A geometric method combining elements of https://sites.google.com/site/geonethome/home[Geonet (Passalacqua et al., 2010)] and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012WR012452/abstract[Pelletier (2013)] methods that we developed for http://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/4/627/2016/esurf-4-627-2016.html[Grieve et al. (2016)] and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JF003747/full[Clubb et al. (2016)] We call this the "Wiener" method (after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter[wiener filter] used to preprocess the data).

These methods are run based on a common interface via the program `lsdtt-channel-extraction`.
