== Get the code for channel extraction

Channel extraction is included within the *LSDTopoTools* package. 

.Quickstart installation
************************************
If you have installed *LSDTopoTools* before, or are familair with Docker, here are very quick instructions.

. Install Docker
. Make a directory to hold all your *LSDTopoTools* code and data. 
. Pull and start the LSDTopoTools container (in the below command it assumes you have put your *LSDTopoTools* directory in `C:/LSDTopoTools`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v C:/LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pcl_docker
----
+
. In the docker container, run the script `Start_LSDTT.sh`
. You are ready to go!

=== Installation of the channel extraction algorithms

. Good news! If you have installed *LSDTopoTools*, you already have the channel extraction tools. 
. In you haven't installed it, follow the link:LSDTT_installation[LSDTopoTools installation instructions].
. The channel extraction code is called `lsdtt-channel-extraction`. 


=== Example datasets 
We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the channel extraction algorithms. In this tutorial we will work using a lidar dataset from Indian Creek, Ohio. 

. You need to get the data from github. 
. The program `git` is installed in our docker conatiner so it is probably most useful to get the datasets via the docker container. If you are in native Linux you probably know what you are doing, so just adapt these instructions to your terminal environment. 
. In the docker container (indicated by the `#` command prompt) make a directory for your data (if you haven't already got one). Here is a suggestion:
+
[source,console]
----
# cd /LSDTopoTools
# mkdir data
# cd data
----
+
. Now clone the test data
+
[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets.git
----
+
. This repository has a number of test datasets. The one we will be using is called `indian_creek.bil` and `indian_creek.hdr`, and the relevant parameter file is `Vagrant_ChannelExtraction.driver`.

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format). The figure below shows a shaded relief map of part of the Indian Creek DEM which will be used in these examples.

NOTE: You can also work with the DEM `gabilan.bil` that is included by default in the `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` folder but you will need tochange the parameter files to reflect the different DEM name.
