== Get the code for channel extraction

Our code for channel extraction can be found in our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction[GitHub repository].  This repository contains code for extracting channel networks using a variety of different methods ranging from simple contributing area thresholds to more complex geometric and theoretical approaches for extracting channels from high-resolution datasets.

=== Getting LSDTopoTools 2

. Follow the link:LSDTT_installation[LSDTopoTools installation instructions].
. The channel extraction code is called `lsdtt-channel-extraction`. 

=== Example datasets 
We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the channel extraction algorithms. In this tutorial we will work using a lidar dataset from Indian Creek, Ohio. 

.If you are using a Vagrant server
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data
----

The DEM is called `indian_creek.bil` and `indian_creek.hdr`, and the relevant parameter file is `Vagrant_ChannelExtraction.driver`.

This dataset is already in the preferred format for use with LSDTopoTools (the ENVI `bil` format). The figure below shows a shaded relief map of part of the Indian Creek DEM which will be used in these examples.

NOTE: You can also work with the DEM `gabilan.bil` that is included by default in the `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Test_data` folder but you will need tochange the parameter files to reflect the different DEM name.
