== Get the code for channel extraction

Channel extraction is included within the *LSDTopoTools* package. 

.Quickstart installation
************************************
If you have installed *LSDTopoTools* before, or are familair with Docker, here are very quick instructions.

. Install Docker
. Make a directory to hold all your *LSDTopoTools* code and data. 
. Pull and start the LSDTopoTools container (in the below command it assumes you have put your *LSDTopoTools* directory in `C:/LSDTopoTools`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v C:/LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pcl_docker
----
+
. In the docker container, run the script `Start_LSDTT.sh`
. You are ready to go!
************************************

=== Installation of the channel extraction algorithms

. Good news! If you have installed *LSDTopoTools*, you already have the channel extraction tools. 
. In you haven't installed it, follow the link:LSDTT_installation[LSDTopoTools installation instructions].
. The channel extraction code is called `lsdtt-channel-extraction`. 


=== Example datasets 
We have provided some example datasets which you can use in order to test the channel extraction algorithms. In this tutorial we will work using a lidar dataset from Indian Creek, Ohio. 


==== Get the test data

If you have followed the link:LSDTT_installation.html[installation instructions] and grabbed the example data, you already have what you need! If not, follow the steps below:

. If you are using a docker container, just run the script:
+
[source,console]
----
# Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
+
. If you are on a native linux or using the University of Edinburgh servers, do the following:
.. If you have installed *LSDTopoTools*, you will have a directory somewhere called `LSDTopoTools`. Go into it. 
.. Run the following commands (you only need to do this once):
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ mv ./ExampleTopoDatasets-master ./ExampleTopoDatasets
$ rm master.zip
----
+
.. WARNING: This downloads a bit over 150Mb of data so make sure you have room.

The datasets for our channel extraction tests are in the subdirectory `/LSDTopoTools/data/ExampleTopoDatasets/ChannelExtractionData` in the Docker container.

There are several datasets within this directory, for the initial tutorial we will focues on the Indan Creek, Ohio DEM. It is in the subdirectory `IndianCreek_1m`
