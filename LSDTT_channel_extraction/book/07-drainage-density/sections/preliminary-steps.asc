=== Preliminary steps

==== Getting the channel head file

Before the drainage density analysis can be run, you must create a channel network for your DEM.  This can be done using any of the channel extraction algorithms within LSDTopoTools. Once you have run the channel extraction algorithm, you must make sure that the `bil` and `hdr` files with the channel head locations are placed in the same folder as the DEM you intend to use for the drainage density analysis. 

==== Selecting a window size

Before we can run the drainage density algorithm, we need to calculate the correct window size for calculating mean hilltop curvature across the DEM.  Please refer to the link:LSDTT_hillslope_metrics.html#_selecting_a_window_size[selecting a window size] section for information on how to calculate a window size for your DEM.
