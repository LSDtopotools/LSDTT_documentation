.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below. 

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]


In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].

== Introduction

Terrestrial landscapes are almost all dissected by channels. Mapping channels and rivers has been a feature of cartography from its start. A few centuries ago, finding river sources use to be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile#Search_for_the_source_of_the_Nile[an amusing way]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River#Origins[to get your name in a newspaper]. In fact, there continue to this day to be stunts looking for http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160516-why-it-is-hard-to-find-the-source-of-rivers-like-the-amazon[the source] http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/4864782.stm[of major rivers].

Taking boats through precarious jungles is good fun for some, but in fact we can now use digital topography to look for the characteristic topographic signs of channels on the landscapes using remotely-sensed data. These signs can simply be the "v-shaped" valleys that you might have learned about in school, or could include more advanced techniques. We now have http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/aw3d30/index.htm[topographic] https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem/[data] https://tandemx-science.dlr.de/[covering the] https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp[entire] https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/[planet] so as long ago as 2005 (when the https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/[SRTM 90 dataset was released]) it was trivially easy to find the longest channel in a river network. 
Knowing in detail where the channel head is, however, is not at all trivial and now that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar[lidar data] is widely available, we can look for topographic signature of channel at scaled approaching those of the actual channel heads.

In this documentation we have compiled several methods for determining the location of channel heads using high resolution data, and ported them into *LSDTopoTools*. These algorithms should be, for the most part, accurate to ~20-30 metres of the actual channel head. For details see the following paper:

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013WR015167/full[Clubb, F. J., S. M. Mudd, D. T. Milodowski, M. D. Hurst, and L. J. Slater (2014), Objective extraction of channel heads from high-resolution topographic data, _Water Resour. Res._, *50*, 4283â€“4304, doi:10.1002/2013WR015167.]

We have also attempted to quantify the resolution of data needed for the different methods; the answer is that you _might_ be able to extract a reasonable channel network from 10 metres resolution data, but 30 metre resolution data is not trustworthy. If you have lidar data, use that. The details are contained in the following paper:

https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/4/627/2016/[Grieve, S. W. D., Mudd, S. M., Milodowski, D. T., Clubb, F. J., and Furbish, D. J.: How does grid-resolution modulate the topographic expression of geomorphic processes?, _Earth Surf. Dynam._, *4*, 627-653, https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-4-627-2016, 2016.]

For completeness we include our historic functions for calculating channel sources, but in general the only tool you will need is <<The Channel Extraction tool>>. We also refer readers to the https://sites.google.com/site/geonethome/home[GeoNet channel extraction tool], which was developed by Paola Passalacqua and colleagues.
