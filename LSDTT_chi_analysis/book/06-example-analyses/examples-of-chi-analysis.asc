== Examples of chi analysis

We will now run some examples of chi analysis using the *chi mapping tool*. 

=== Start LSDTopoTools

. We assume you have compiled the chi analysis tool (if not, follow the link:LSDTT_installation[LSDTopoTools installation instructions]).
. You need to start an *LSDTopoTools* session. 
.. If you are using Docker , start the container:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -it -v C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pcl_docker
----
+
.. Then run the start script.
+
[source,console]
----
# Start_LSDTT.sh
----
+
. If you are in a native linux session, then you need to activate the LSDTT terminal. 
.. Navigate to the LSDTopoTools2 directory. 
.. Run `sh LSDTT_terminal.sh`. 

=== Get the test data

If you have followed the link:LSDTT_installation.html[installation instructions] and grabbed the example data, you already have what you need! If not, follow the steps below:

. If you are using a docker container, just run the script:
+
[source,console]
----
# Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
. If you are on a native linux or using the University of Edinburgh servers, do the following:
.. If you have installed *LSDTopoTools*, you will have a directory somewhere called `LSDTopoTools`. Go into it. 
.. Run the following commands (you only need to do this once):
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ mv ./ExampleTopoDatasets-master ./ExampleTopoDatasets
$ rm master.zip
