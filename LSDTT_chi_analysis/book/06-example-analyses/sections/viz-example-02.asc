=== Chi mapping of multiple basins using LSDMappingTools

Now that you have done <<Third example: selecting basins by hand,examples 3 and 4>>, we can plot the data using *LSDMappingTools*. 

. Go back into the Docker visualisation container.
. Run the plotting script with some new flags:
.. `-all True` tells the plotting script you want to plot both raster and profile plots.
.. `-basin_lists 0,1,2` tells the plotting script you want to collect these three basins into a "stack". If you want to play with this, you can try `-basin_lists 0,1:2` which will create two stacks. 
.. `-chi_offsets 10` indicates that in your stacked plots, the profiles are separated by 10 m in chi space (the dimensions of chi are in m). The default is 5 m so you can play with this. The default of flow distance happens to work in this example but if you want to change that the flag is `-fd_offsets`
+
. This creates figures in both the `raster_plots` and `chi_profile_plots` directories. 
. Here are a selection of the plots:
+
.A plot of the channel steepness (k_sn_) near Xi'an.
image::images/Xian_ksn.png[A plot of the channel steepness in near Xi'an]
+
.A stacked channel profile plot of three basins, in chi space, near Xi'an

=== Images produced when using PlotChiAnalysis.py `-all True`

The following are the images that are produced when you run `PlotChiAnalysis.py` with the flag `-all True`

Yes, we are aware the filenames are stupid, but we can't be bothered to change that right now.

|`Stacked_N_chi_stacked_chi.png`
|The stacked plot of the profiles in chi space. The default is to colour by _k~sn~_. The `N` is the number of the stack. 


|`Stacked_N_FD_stacked_chi.png`
|The stacked plot of the profiles in flow distance space. The default is to colour by _k~sn~_. The `N` is the number of the stack. 

|`Stacked_N_sources_stacked_chi.png`
|The stacked plot of the profiles in flow distance space, coloured by the source number. The `N` is the number of the stack.

[cols="1,4", options="header"]
.Images from the `PlotChiAnalysis.py` script in the `raster_plots` subdirectory

|Filename contains
|Image

|`_basins_selected_basins.png`
|Shows a raster of the basins that have been selected for the analysis.


|`_ksn_chi_channels_and_basins.png`
|Raster plot of the channel steepness (_k~sn~_).


|`_stack_basins_selected_basins.png`
|This shows the selected basins, but the different stacks are coloured differently so the user can see which basins are grouped in each stack of channel profiles. 

|`sources_chi_channels_and_basins.png`
|Raster plot showing the channels coloured by their sources. This and the `Stacked_N_sources_stacked_chi.png` help users to identify which tributaries are which in the plots.
