=== Third example: selecting basins by hand

Okay, the previous examples selected basins algorithmically, and then following example just got the largest basin. We now will select some basins by hand. At the moment this is a two stage process.

. Go back to the docker container where you did the first two examples (i.e., not the visualisation container).
. Run the thrid example:
+
[source,console]
----
$ lsdtt-chi-mapping Xian_example03.driver
----
+
. In this example, we are just printing the locations of the junction to a csv file with the flag `print_junctions_to_csv: true`
+
. This will print out all the junctions to a `csv` and `geojson` file, and if you load the `geojson` file into your favourite GIS you will see something like this:
