=== Examples using LSDMappingTools

We are now going to take a brief detour into our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[mapping tools]. 

https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[*LSDMappingTools*] are written in python and have been built up over the years to avoid having to click mice and interact with GIS software. 

==== Installing LSDMappingTools for chi visualisation

The main barrier to using *LSDMappingTools* is installing the python packages. We have done all that work for you in a https://hub.docker.com/r/lsdtopotools/lsdtt_viz_docker[Docker container].

You can also install the conda environment by using our https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools/master/conda_environments/conda_list_July2019.txt[latest conda environment file]. 

.Quick installation instructions
***********************************************

Full instructions are on the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_visualisation.html#_installing_the_lsdtopotools_python_toolchain[LSDTopoTools visualisation section].

The basic instructions are:

* In docker:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -it -v C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_viz_docker
----
+
* For native installation:
** Download and install https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[miniconda] (python 3 version).
** Grab the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools/master/conda_environments/conda_list_July2019.txt[environment file].
** Run:
+
[source,console]
----
$ conda create --name LSDMT --file conda_list_July2019.txt
----
+
Note: if you don't save the file as `conda_list_July2019.txt` then you will need to change the name of the file above. 
+
** Warning: this method will take *a very long time*. The docker version is much, much faster and less likeley to fail.

==== Plotting some chi results

. The first example plots the data from example 1:
+
[source,console]
----
python PlotChiAnalysis.py -dir /LSDTopoTools/data/ExampleTopoDatasets/ChiAnalysisData/Xian/ -fname Xian -PB True
