=== Visualising the results of our concavity analyses

IMPORTANT: You need to run the analysis before any of this will work!

We have built a single python script that does all the visualisation for you. It works with one call to the script: _*easy peasy!!*_

Unfortunately there are a few hiccups in getting the python installed, which we link:LSDTT_visualisation.html#_installing_the_lsdtopotools_python_toolchain[describe in a separate section on visualisation].

This will be slightly different than instructions in that section, since the advice there is to run python scripts from *spyder*. In this instance, we will run from command line. 

==== Generating all the plots

. Open a command shell window (search your start menu for *cmd.exe*).

. If you have installed a conda environment for *LSDTopoTools* (see the section on link:LSDTT_visualisation.html#_installing_the_lsdtopotools_python_toolchain[setting up Python] for details), activate it with:
+
[source,console]
----
> activate LSDTT
----
+
. Now, go to the place you cloned *LSDMappingTools*. For instructions on that look here: link:LSDTT_visualisation.html#_getting_our_strong_lsdmappingtools_strong_and_other_tools[Getting our plotting tools]. You will need to use the `cd` command to get there.  
+ 
. Once you are in the correct directory, you need to run the python script:
+
[source,console]
----
> python PlotMOverNAnalysis.py -dir C:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Topographic_projects\LSDTT_chi_examples\ -fname movern_Xian -ALL True
----
+
Note here that we have assumed you have put your files, on your host machine, in `C:\VagrantBoxes\`. If your files are somewhere else you need to change this. The `-dir` flag wants the directory of the data and the `-fname` flag wants the prefix of the data. The `-ALL` flag means you want to do all the plotting. 
+
. This can take a little while. Why don't you relax and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcLhUiYrZhA[watch a video] while you wait?

==== What sort of plots do I get?

In your data directory you will now find not one, not two, but *four*, yes *four* new directories:

* `raster_plots`
* `SA_plots`
* `chi_plots`
* `summary_plots`

These contain a cornucopia of images for you to explore. Any you got all this for free!! If you use this software you might consider buying https://fclubb.github.io/[Fiona Clubb] a coffee or beer when you see her at a conferences given the amount of time she has just saved you by writing these routines. 


===== Figures in the *Raster_plots* directory

The *raster_plots* directory contains images of the extracted basins:

.The extracted basins for the concavity analysis
image::images/movern_Xian_basin_keys.png[Basins around Mount Hua for concavity analysis]

It also contains images of the most likely concavity following three methods: slope-area analysis, collinearity analysis of chi profiles using all channel points, collinearity using chi points at random intervals iterated upon using bootstrapping, and collinearity using a https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/4/1/2016/esurf-4-1-2016.html[disorder metric]. Our extensive testing against numerical models under ideal conditions suggest the least trustworthy of these extracted concavity values is the slope-area data, whereas the most trustworthy are the data derived from disorder and bootstrapping approaches. It is not possible to know which of these methods is "true" but if all methods agree you can have high confidence in the concavity and if they disagree our guidance is to use the disorder and bootstrapping methods.

===== Figures in the *SA_plots* directory

This folder contains two versions of slope-area plots. The first contains the slope area data of all the tributaries, for example:

.S-A data of all channels in the basin
image::images/movern_Xian_SA_plot_raw_and_binned_basin6.png[S-A data of all channels in the basin]

The second set of S-A data contains only the trunk channel and also has segments extracted from the http://www.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/abstract[Mudd et al. (2014)] segmentation algorithm. 

.S-A data of the trunk stream with statistically extracted segments.

===== Figures in the *chi_plots* directory

This directory has a large number of images: each chi-elevation plot for each basin for each concavity value tested. If you are seeing interesting patterns in the raster data you should absolutely explore these plots to see what the chi profiles are doing as you vary concavity.

===== Figures in the *summary_plots* directory

We also print summary plots that let you explore the variation of computed concavity values across a landscape. There are three plots in this directory and two *.csv* files that contain the underlying data. The three plots are

. A plot showing the best fit concavity as a function of basin key that includes the various chi methods and the slope-area method using a regression through all the data. 
+
.Summary plot of most likely concavity ratio for various methods

+
. A plot showing the best fit concavity for just the bootstrap and disorder methods, which we have found to be the most reliable. 
+
