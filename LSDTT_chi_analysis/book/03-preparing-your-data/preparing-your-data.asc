== Preparing your data 

.Essential information about data preparation
*************************************************************
Our software calculates metrics over entire landscapes and along channels, and needs to measure distances and lengths. For this reason the data *must* be in a https://geonet.esri.com/thread/23160[projected reference system]. Because converting data types is nontrivial, we have opted to assume a certain reference system:

**All your raster data (i.e., your topographic data and subsidiary datasets) need to be in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system[UTM] coordinate system.**

We use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system[the UTM coordinate system] since it is a global dataset. However you will need to look up the UTM zone of your data. We use http://www.dmap.co.uk/utmworld.htm[this map] to determine our UTM zone. 

**If you fail to convert to UTM these programs will probably crash!**

Please read our section on link:LSDTT_introduction_to_geospatial_data.html[geospatial data] for more information about the data needs of *LSDTopoTools*
*************************************************************


=== Get some data

To run *LSDTopoTools* you need some topographic datasets! 

* A list of good sources for geospatial data can be found link:LSDTT_introduction_to_geospatial_data.html#_downloading_data[on our geospatial section of the documentaiton].

Once you download data you will need to convert it into a format and projection suitable for *LSDTopoTools*. If you have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_data[raster data], the best way to preprocess your data is via http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL]. 

=== Use GDAL

http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL] is a library for dealing with geospatial data. 

You can read about how to convert data formats using GDAL in link:LSDTT_introduction_to_geospatial_data.html#_gdal[this section of our geospatial data documentation].

If you don't want to run command line tools, QGIS bundles GDAL so every transformation and projection in QGIS is performed by GDAL. Thus, you can load rasters in QGIS and transform them into the correct coordinate system using the QGIS projection tools. Again, rasters should be projected into UTM coordinates.
