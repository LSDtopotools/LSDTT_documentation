== Preface by Simon Mudd

Channels in upland landscapes and mountains are not just beautiful. They also store information about tectonics, lithology, erosion and climate, and how those things have changed though time. Extracting this information is a challenging task that has occupied the efforts of geomorphologists for several hundred years. I will wait while you read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley_Powell[John Wesley Powell's] https://archive.org/details/explorationcolo01goodgoog[book on the exploration of the Colorado river from 1875]. Finished? Excellent. 

Over the last few decades we have built up a theoretical basis for quantifying channel profiles and interpreting their steepness. We now have excellent global coverage of topography, so getting topographic data from any river in the world has never been easier. Analysis of that data can be time consuming and difficult, however. Over the last 5 years here at Edinburgh we have developed tools for automating analysis of river profiles. These tools sit within our software: http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools]. The motivation to develop these tools is our belief that any analysis of topography in support of geomorphic work should be easily reproduced by readers of original papers. 

This website deals with those components of *LSDTopoTools* dedicated to analysing channels, which builds upon some of the work we http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/full[published in 2014]. That software was rather difficult to run. After a few years of attempting to get undergraduates to use it, and having feedback from other users, we are pleased to present a updated version of the code. The new version is a much more automated version of the original code. In addition, we have substantially added flexibility and a number of new features. We hope to publish a description of the new features alongside some insights into landscape evolution in the near future. For now, I hope you find this easy enough to understand and install so that you can start exploring your own favourite rivers. I'm always pleaded to hear from users, so don't hesitate to contact me about the software.
