== Preliminary steps

=== Getting the channel head file

Before the floodplain/terrace extraction algorithm can be run, you must create a channel network for your DEM.  This can be done using the link:LSDTT_channel_extraction.html[channel extration] algorithms within LSDTopoTools.  There are several channel extraction algorithms which you can choose from: for more details please refer to the link:LSDTT_channel_extraction.html[channel extration section].  Once you have run the channel extraction algorithm, you must make sure that the `csv` file with the channel head locations is placed in the same folder as your DEM.

If you are computing floodplains you might want a fancy channel extraction algorithm (like Driech or the Wiener method, see the channel extraction documentation), but for terraces you really are only going to need to pick up the big channels and you can get those with threshold drainage area. So you may with to save some time by extracting channels with this method for terrace studies. 

=== Finding the correct window size

Before we can run the floodplain/terrace extraction algorithm, we need to calculate the correct window size for calculating slope across the DEM.  This is used to calculate the thresholds for floodplain/terrace identification.  Please refer to the link:LSDTT_hillslope_metrics.html#_selecting_a_window_size[selecting A window size] section for information on how to calculate a window size for your DEM.  We suggest a value of around 6 m for 1 m resolution DEMs, and a value of 15 m for 10 m resoluton DEMs.
