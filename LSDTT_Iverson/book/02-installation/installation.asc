== Installation

All the code has been developed, tested and ran on `UNIX` platform. It requires uses of a {cpp} compiler and a `python 3` environment.

=== The code

The code has been developed within the open-source [LSDTopoTools]https://lsdtopotools.github.io/ research software suite. All the code can be downloaded from github using version control tool `git`. The {Cpp} code is constituted of 11 files requiring compilation into an executable to be used. The `python` code is distributed as a package that can be easily installed with a python packaged manager (e.g., `pip`). Both are available on *ADD REPO HERE* To download the code, you can run the following command:

[source,console]
----
git clone *ADD ADDRESS HERE*
----


=== Compiling the model

The {cpp} code requires compilation into an executable before use. This can be done with the `GNU g++` compiler, installed in most `UNIX` and `IOS` distributions. The `Analysis_driver` folder in the root folder contains a `make` file that automates the compilation. It can be simply ran as follow:

[source,console]
----
make -f iverson_model.make
----

It generates an executable file named `iverson_model.exe` in the same folder and is ready to be used.

=== Installing the `python` package

The `python` package can be installed in any `python` environment satisfying the following dependencies: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `pytables` and `matplotlib`.
