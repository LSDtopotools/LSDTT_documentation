== Forewords

This documentation is part of a deliverable for the project GSTP project in the WP 4.

== Introduction

WP 4 aims to evaluate the performance of using remote sensing data to detect and anticipate landslide activity. Simulating and anticipating slope failure can be a delicate operation. A common approach consists in modelling background pore pressure to generate static safety maps determining area of risks, Iverson (2000) suggested a transient pore pressure modelling approach to consider the time-evolution of the effect of precipitation and soil water content on slope stability. Such a model is highly case-dependent and requires a significant amount of expensive and time-consuming in-situ monitoring of soil hydrolic, mechanic and hydrogeologic features. The aim of this code and WP is to use an already-monitored site to apply Iverson (2000) model and compare the performance of the model constrained with in-situ data with the model constrained with remote-sensing derived data. The following documentation proposes a protocol to run the model from the different set of data and how to visualise and explore the outputs. The core of the modelling code is written in C++ to ensure reasonable performances and most of the visualisation and high-level control on the code is written in `python`.

=== Parameters

A number of parameters are required to manually enter in the model:

* The model categorically needs precipitation data input to simulate the transient pore pressure evolution in the modeled soil column. This data has to be formated as _precipitation intensity_ in length unit per time unit, preferably in seconds.
* Hydraulic parameters from the modelled soil: the hydraulic diffusivity (_D0_), the Hydraulic conductivity (_Ksat_), the steady-state infiltration rates (_Iz/Kz_).
* The depth of the water table and of the substrate.
* The mechanical soil properties, soil cohesion (soil capacity to resist to motion), friction angle, weight of soil and weight of water.
* The landscape property: topographic slope.
* The model resolution.

=== Model output

The main applicable output of the model is a factor of safety for a soil columns that determines when the slope is subjected to fail. This factor of safety is an absolute value defined by equation 18 in Iverson (2000). It suggests failure when such an ouput is `<=1`. This factor of safety is calculated for a given time and depth of the modelled soil column in regard to the precipitations time series inputed.

=== Global approach

For a specific site, either remote-sensed and in-situ data won't be able to propose restricted values for each parameters. It will suggest a range of suitable parameters
