== Preprocessing the precipitation data

The most sensible parameter inputted in the model is the precipitation data. This can be from in-situ measurements, global dataset or simulations. The data needs to be in a `csv` (Comma-separated-values) files containing the following columns:

[source,csv]
----
duration_s,intensity_mm_sec
...,...
----

Where `duration_s` represent a duration in seconds and `intensity_mm_sec` is the corresponding precipitation intensity in mm per seconds. This last usually requires conversion from common dataset. For example, `15 mm` of rain in 3 hours becomes `15/10800=0.001389 mm/seconds`.

== Run the model for a single soil column

The following instructions describe how to run the code and visualise the outputs for a single soil column simulated.

=== Simulation

Once compiled, the {Cpp} executable can be run from the command-line and need to be directed to a parameter file (a text file containing a series of values telling the {Cpp} model how to simulate the soil command). The parameter files can be written as follow in a text file:

[source, parameter file]
----
# This is a parameter file for the Iverson model
# Lines beginning with # are comments and are not read by the softwares

# The read path represent the path where the data will be read
read path: /path/to/file/
# The write path represent the path where the data will be written (Can be the same than the read path)
write path: /path/to/file/
# Write fname is the prefix of the written files
write fname: 20150711_20160809_filtered

# Name of the csv file containing the preprocessed precipitation data
rainfall_csv: preprocessed_data.csv

# Parameters for the models
D_0: 0.000005
K_sat: 0.00000005
d: 2
Iz_over_K_steady: 0.2
alpha: 0.51
friction_angle: 0.38
cohesion: 12000
weight_of_soil: 19000
weight_of_water: 9800
depth_spacing: 0.1
n_depths: 35


#end of file
----

The executable needs to know the path and the name of the parameter file to read them correctly. From a terminal in the folder containing the compiled executable, the following command will run the model:

[source,console]
----
./iverson_model.exe /path/to/the/parameter/file/ name_of_the_parameter_file.param
----

Note that the parameter file is a text file and can be saved with any extensions (e.g., `.param`, `.driver`). The following parameters can be provided to the model.

=== Model outputs

The {Cpp} model outputs 6 `csv` files containing the evolution of various characteristics of the soil column. Four csv files contain the time series of the different components of the Factor of Safety (FS) functions of time and depth. The independent components of FS are described in equations 28 (a,b and c) and their time series are in files `XXX_time_series_depth_Fcomp.csv` , where `XXX` is the `write fname` in the parameter file and `Fcomp` the corresponding component. It also output the final FS as well as the evolution of the transient pore pressure (Psi) in the file ` _time_series_depth_Psi.csv ` . Finally
