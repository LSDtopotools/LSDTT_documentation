== Overview

Welcome to the main documentation page for http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*]!

*LSDTopoTools* is a software package for analysing topography. Applications of these analyses span hydrology, geomorphology, soil science, ecology, and cognate fields. The software began within the https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/research/research-institutes/global-change/land-surface-dynamics[Land Surface Dynamics group] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/[University of Edinburgh], and now has developers and users around the world. 

The documentation is organised into a series of websites, listed below in the link:index.html#_strong_lsdtopotools_strong_documentation_topics[LSDTopoTools documentation topics] section.

We are in the process of updating all the documentation to work with https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2[LSDTopoTools version 2]. If you want the old version of the documentation, download the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_documentation/releases/tag/v1.01[documentation v1.01], unzip, and go into the *html_build* directory. Click on `index.html` to navigate the old version of the documentation.

.Extreme quickstart
************************************************
If you are familiar with Docker, here is an extreme quickstart guide. For other installation options, read link:LSDTT_installation[the installation section].

. Make a directory for *LSDTopoTools*
. Open a terminal and start our docker container:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run --rm -it -v C:/LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pcl_docker
----
+
NOTE: In the above example the LSDTopoTools directory is in the `C:\` drive. You will need to update this to reflect your directory structure. 
+
. In the Docker container run the startup script
+
[source,console]
----
# Start_LSDTT.sh
----
+
. If you want the example data run the following script (this only needs to be done once):
+
[source,console]
----
# Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
+
. You should be ready to run some analyses!

== Where is all the code?

The code lives as a series of repositories on Github: https://github.com/LSDtopotools
We have packaged these up for you if you use a https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] container, so all you need to do to get started is grab our container from https://hub.docker.com/r/lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pcl_docker[Docker hub] and run a startup script. 

Currently, in *LSDTopoTools version 2* all drivers will be housed within a https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2[single LSDTopoTools v2 repository], but some functionality is still within older application specific repositories. Please check back for updates.
