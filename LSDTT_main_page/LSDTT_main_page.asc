== Overview

Welcome to the main documentation page for http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*]!

*LSDTopoTools* is a software package for analysing topography. Applications of these analyses span hydrology, geomorphology, soil science, ecology, and cognate fields. The software began within the https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/research/research-institutes/global-change/land-surface-dynamics[Land Surface Dynamics group] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/[University of Edinburgh], and now has developers and users around the world. 

The documentation is organised into a series of websites, listed below in the link:index.html#_strong_lsdtopotools_strong_documentation_topics[LSDTopoTools documentation topics] section.

We are in the process of updating all the documentation to work with https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2[LSDTopoTools version 2]. If you want the old version of the documentation, download the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_documentation/releases/tag/v1.01[documentation v1.01], unzip, and go into the *html_build* directory. Click on `index.html` to navigate the old version of the documentation.

.Extreme quickstart with Docker
************************************************
If you are familiar with Docker, here is an extreme quickstart guide. For other installation options, read link:LSDTT_installation[the installation section].

. Make a directory for *LSDTopoTools*
. Open a terminal and start our docker container that includes the full LSDTopoTools stack:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -it -v C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools -p 8888:8888 lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker
----
+
NOTE: In the above example the LSDTopoTools directory is in the `C:\` drive. You will need to update this to reflect your directory structure. 
+
. You can run *lsdtopotools* command line tools straight away. 
+
. In addition, you can access *lsdtopotools* through a notebook. Just run 
+
[source,console]
----
# jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser --allow-root
----
+
and then open a web browser to http://localhost:8888/. Once there you need to add a token that you can find on the docker window. 
+
. Some example notebooks are here: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdtt_notebooks
+
. If you want the example data run the following script (this only needs to be done once):
+
[source,console]
----
# Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
+
. You should be ready to run some analyses!
+
. If you want to run a jupyter notebook you use:
+
[source,console]
----
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser --allow-root
----
+
. You can grab example notebooks here: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdtt_notebooks
************************************************

.Extreme quickstart with conda and pip
************************************************
You can also install our tools with `conda` and `pip`. If you don't know what those are then follow the Docker instructions. 

. You probably want to set up and environment before doing anything. If you don't know what that is follow the Docker instructions. 
. `conda install -c conda-forge lsdtopotools`
. `conda install -c conda-forge lsdtopytools`
. `pip install lsdviztools`
************************************************

== What is in the full LSDTopoTools stack?

. You get the lsdtopotools command line tools. To get help without reading the documentation run the command line script with `-h`. This will produce a csv file that contains all of the parameters, their default values, their description, and advice on their use. The scripts are:
.. `lsdtt-basic-metrics` for basic topographic analysis
.. `lsdtt-channel-extraction` to extract channels
.. `lsdtt-chi-mapping` to analyse channel profiles
.. `lsdtt-cosmo-tool` to compute erosion rates based on 10Be and 26Al
.. `lsdtt-hillslope-channel-coupling` to connect ridgetop metrics to channels
.. `lsdtt-valley-metrics` to extract valleys, floodplains, and terraces.
. The lsdtopytools python interface so you can run step by step analysis in a jupyter notebook. 
. lsdviztools which can either be run in a jupyter notebook or with command line scripts. Again, to get help, call the script with `-h`. This will print the help to screen. The lsdviztools scripts are:
.. `lsdtt-grabopentopographydata` for getting topographic data from opentopography.org
.. `lsdtt_plotbasicrasters` for rudimentary raster plotting
.. `lsdtt_plotchianalysis` for plotting chi-elevation profiles, steepness maps, etc.
.. `lsdtt_plotconcavityanalysis` for plotting analysis of the concavity index, which is useful for tectonic geomorphology.

== Where is all the code?

Unless you are a developer, you don't need to look at the code. But if you are, the code lives as a series of repositories on Github: https://github.com/LSDtopotools
We have packaged these up for you if you use a https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker] container, so all you need to do to get started is grab our container from https://hub.docker.com/r/lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker[Docker hub], which has everything you need pre-installed. 

The actual code is in these three gitub repositories:

* https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2
* https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdtopytools
* https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdviztools
