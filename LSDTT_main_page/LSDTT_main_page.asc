== Overview

Welcome to the main documentation page for http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*]!

*LSDTopoTools* is a software package for analysing topography. Applications of these analyses span hydrology, geomorphology, soil science, ecology, and cognate fields. The software began within the https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/research/research-institutes/global-change/land-surface-dynamics[Land Surface Dynamics group] at the https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/[University of Edinburgh], and now has developers and users around the world. 

The documentation is organised into a series of websites, listed below in the link:index.html#_strong_lsdtopotools_strong_documentation_topics[LSDTopoTools documentation topics] section.

We are in the process of updating all the documentaion to work with https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2[LSDTopoTools version 2]. If you want the old version of the documentation, download the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_documentation/releases/tag/v1.01[documentation v1.01], unzip, and go into the *html_build* directory. Click on `index.html` to navigate the old version of the documentation.

== Where is all the code?

The code lives as a series of repositories on Github: https://github.com/LSDtopotools

In *LSDTopoTools version 2* all drivers will be housed within a https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools2[single LSDTopoTools v2 repository], but some functionality is still within older application specific repositories. Please check back for updates.
