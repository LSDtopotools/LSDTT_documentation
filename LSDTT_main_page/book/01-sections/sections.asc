|Description

|link:LSDTT_general_overview.html[Background and philosophy of LSDTopoTools]
|This brief document describes some of the background to *LSDTopoTools* and the philosophy behind having open, reproducible topographic analysis software.

|link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]
|A guide to installation of *LSDTopoTools*. Includes instructions for all operating systems, using Docker, or native Linux installation at the University of Edinburgh or elsewhere.

|link:LSDTT_basic_usage.html[Basic topographic analyses in LSDTopoTools]
|This is the launch point for your first analyses in *LSDTopoTools*. The documents take you through some basic steps and show how to do simple, everyday analyses like calculating gradient and curvature, calculate drainage areas, and extract channel networks.

=== Background reading and associated software

If you are doing topographic analysis, you will need more than just the core *LSDTopoTools* packages. These documents contain instructions on how to get raster data (primarily topographic data) and manipulate it with http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL], how to look at data in http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS], how to use a Linux shell, and how to build our documentation on your own computer. This last section will likely only appeal to *LSDTopoTools* developers. The rest of you can just view the documents on the web.

|Description


|link:LSDTT_introduction_to_geospatial_data.html[Introduction to geospatial data]
|A brief introduction to geospatial data. Where to get it, how to manipulate it, and information about the different forms of this data.

|link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[A very brief introduction to using a Linux shell]
|To use *LSDTopoTools* you need to issue commands in a Linux shell. This contains minimal instructions on how to navigate in this environment.

|link:LSDTT_QGIS.html[Some tips and tricks for using QGIS]
|The contains some brief notes about using QGIS. Not *LSDTopoTools* specific, but should be useful if you want to look at output using a GIS.

|link:LSDTT_building_documentation.html[Building the LSDTopoTools documentation]
|An overview of how to build the *LSDTopoTools* documentation. Most users will not need this: they can just look at the documents online!

=== *LSDTopoTools* visualisation and python

The serious number crunching in *LSDTopoTools* is done in pass:[C++] code, but the output needs to be visulaised with either a GIS or python. Below are documents associated with GIS and python scripts.

|link:LSDTT_visualisation.html[Visualisation with LSDMappingTools]
|Explanation of how *LSDMappingTools*, our python visualisation toolkit to get our python tools working. Includes some basic python notes. Also some pointers to our GIS sections.

=== *LSDTopoTools* analysis packages

These documents describe our individual analysis packages. They are more specialised than the link:LSDTT_basic_usage.html[basic metrics program]. We use these packages for research: most of them are associated with one or more scientific publications, or our collaborations with government, humanitarian organisations and private businesses.

|Description

|link:LSDTT_channel_extraction.html[Extracting channels using LSDTopoTools]
|Documentation for our channel extraction algorithms.

|link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[Channel steepness analysis with LSDTopoTools]
|Documentation for our tools for analysing channel profiles and extracting the chi coordinate. These tools are used to make inferences about erosion and/or uplift rates, as well as detecting signals of divide migration. 

|link:LSDTT_knickpoint_analysis.html[Knickpoint analysis with LSDTopoTools]
|Documentation for our tools for extracting knickpoints and knickzones from river profiles. Uses the same program as that used for link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[general chi analysis].

|link:LSDTT_BasinwideCRN.html[Computing erosion rates based on ^10^Be and ^26^Al concentrations with LSDTopoTools]
|Documentation for our tools for calculating erosion rates using in-situ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogenic_nuclide[cosmogenic nuclides].

|link:LSDTT_floodplains_terraces.html[Floodplain and terrace analysis using LSDTopoTools]
|Documentation for our tools for extracting floodplains and terraces. Note that this requires the extra dependencies that you can read about in the last section of the link:LSDTT_installation.html[installation instructions].


|link:LSDTT_hillslope_metrics.html[Hillslope metrics using LSDTopoTools]
|Documentation on how to get hillslope lengths, ridgetop curvature, hillslope relief and similar operations that can aid in determining sediment flux laws and landscape transience.
