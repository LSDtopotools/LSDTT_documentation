.*LSDTopoTools* developers
|===
|Person
|Notes

|Simon M. Mudd
|Started the *LSDRaster* and *LSDFlowInfo* objects as a 3 month side project. "Lead developer" by virtue of being dumb enough to start the project. 95% of errors and examples of poor design are his fault. But being lead developer means he has many opportunities to leave [little] secrets in the code.
|Martin D. Hurst
|Martin's original code, linking python to ArcMap, was one of the inspirations for the initial version of the software. He has written a number of the routines associated with extracting tectonic information from lidar data.

|David T. Milodowski
|Wrote many of the filtering and surface metric algorithms. Also wrote algorithms related to ecology, and has contributed throughout the code.

|Stuart W.D. Grieve
|Wrote many of the hillslope length algorithms (along with Martin) as well as many of the algorithms and objects related to basin selection and processing. 

|Fiona J. Clubb
|Wrote many of the channel extraction algorithms as well as the floodplain and terrace algorithms. Has contributed throughout the software.

|Marie-Alice Harel
|Wrote a number of automation algorithms for cosmogenic processing and linking basin erosion statistics to channel properties.

|Declan A. Valters
|The lead developer of HAIL-CAESER, an LSDTopoTools port of CAESAR-LISFLOOD. Also helped write channel steepness analysis algorithms and a number of visualisation tools.

|Boris Gailleton
|Has developed, along with Fiona Clubb, the knickpoint extraction algorithms. Also has developed routines for linking lithology to topography.
