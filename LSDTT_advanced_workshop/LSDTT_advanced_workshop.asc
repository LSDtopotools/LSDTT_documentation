== Introduction

*LSDTopoTools* is software for performing topographic analysis of landscapes, with applications in hydrology, ecology, soil science, and geomorphology.

Firstly, we should tell you that LSD stands for _Land Surface Dynamics_,
and is named after http://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/research/research-institutes/global-change/land-surface[Land Surface Dynamics research cluster]
in the http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/geosciences/[School of GeoSciences] at the http://www.ed.ac.uk/home[University of Edinburgh].

Today we'll use the code to (hopefully) extract channel networks, get maps of slope and curvature across the landscape, and do some chi profile analysis.

== The philosophy behind LSDTopoTools

LSDTopoTools is a software package designed to analyse landscapes for applications in geomorphology, hydrology, ecology and allied fields. It is not intended as a substitute for a GIS, but rather is designed to be a research and analysis tool that produces reproducible data. The motivations behind its development were:

1. To serve as a framework for implementing the latest developments in topographic analysis.

2. To serve as a framework for developing new topographic analysis techniques.

3. To serve as a framework for numerical modelling of landscapes (for hydrology, geomorphology and ecology).

4. To improve the speed and performance of topographic analysis versus other tools (e.g., commercial GIS software).

5. To enable reproducible topographic analysis in the research context.

The toolbox is organised around objects, which are used to store and manipulate specific kinds of data, and driver functions, which users write to interface with the objects.

== Getting started

=== Installing LSDTopoTools

Hopefully everyone managed to get the code installed either on Windows using vagrant, Mac with docker, or Linux natively.  If you had problems getting it to install, then just let me know and I will help out!

You can also find detailed installation instructions https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_installation.html[here].

=== Basic code structure and organisation

Our analyses are packaged into separate programs. They are run from the Linux shell. All of our programs operate the same way:

* You keep the program and the data in two different directories.
* The directory with the data also has a parameter file, which contains instructions for the program.
* You have to tell the program where the data directory is, as well as the name of the parameter file. You do this from the command line.

.Basic setup of LSDTopoTools. There are two main directories: the read directory where the data is stored, and the driver directory where the code is stored

We have already set up this directory structure for you with `LSDTopoToolsSetup.py`. The folder `/LSDTopoTools/` has the structure:

[source,console]
----
/LSDTopoTools/
--Git_projects
--Topographic_projects
----
All of the code is stored in the `Git_projects` folder, and all of the DEMs can be stored in the `Topographic_projects` folder.

=== Get the example datasets

I have transformed the Santa Cruz dataset into the correct format for our code. All the DEMs need to be in the ENVI BIL format (see our https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_introduction_to_geospatial_data.html[instructions] if you're interested in how to transform the DEMs).  You can get the 1m dataset of the Pozo catchment, and the 1 and 10 m DEMs of the whole Santa Cruz island https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i97fGk4SVtljjPpu-d2jCcIg8sp9MZBn[here].

I suggest we make a new folder in the `Topographic_projects` directory called `Santa_Cruz` for today, and put all the DEMs in there.  This shared folder also contains an example parameter file for extracting channel networks, getting slopes and curvatures, and doing chi profile analysis on the Pozo catchment.   These parameter files also need to be stored in the `Santa_Cruz` folder.
