== Getting slope and curvature maps

Now we'll do some basic topographic analysis using our program *LSDTT_BasicMetrics*. This program can extract topographic metrics like slope, aspect and curvature. The program is intended for everyday data processing. A number of these operations are available in GIS software, but we tend to prefer *LSDTopoTools* because the slope and curvature metrics in typical GIS software only uses information from the nearest pixels. We fit a polynomial surface from a neighbourhood of pixels. See http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JF002057/abstract[Hurst et al., 2012, DOI: 10.1029/2011JF002057] and https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/4/627/2016/[Grieve et al., 2016, doi:10.5194/esurf-4-627-2016] for the rationale.

=== Parameter files

Similar to the channel extraction, we also need to define a parameter file for running the slope and curvature analysis.  An example for our DEM is shown below, which again needs to be in the same directory as the DEM:

----
# Parameters for extracting simple surface metrics
# Comments are preceded by the hash symbol

# These are parameters for the file i/o
# IMPORTANT: You MUST make the write directory: the code will not work if it doesn't exist.
read path: /opt/LSDTopoTools/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Santa_Cruz/
write path: /opt/LSDTopoTools/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Santa_Cruz/
read fname: Pozo_DTM
write fname: Pozo_DTM
channel heads fname: NULL

# Parameters for surface metrics
surface_fitting_radius: 7
print_slope: true
print_aspect: true
print_curvature: true
print_tangential_curvature: true
----

=== Run the code

To get the slope and curvature, we're going to use a different repository than for the channel extraction. Navigate to the folder:

[source, console]
----
$ cd /opt/LSDTopoTools/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver/
----

You can then run the code with:

[source, console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /path/to/input/data/ name_of_parameter_file.param
----

For our example, we would have:

[source, console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /opt/LSDTopoTools/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Santa_Cruz/ LSDTT_BasicMetrics.param
----
