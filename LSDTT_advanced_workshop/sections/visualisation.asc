== Visualisation

If you look in the `Santa_Cruz` folder you'll now see a lot of different rasters and CSV files that have been produced as a result of the analysis.  We can load these into QGIS for a first look at the data.  Some interesting things to look at might be:

1. *Channel extraction*: we output the results of the channel extraction as a stream order raster (with the extension `_SO`), a CSV of the full channel network (extension `_CN`), and a CSV with all of the channel heads (extension `_sources`).  Each channel extraction algorithm has a different letter associated with it, so area threshold is `AT`, DrEICh is `D`, Wiener is `W`, and Pelletier is `P`.

2. *Basic metrics*: this is pretty self explanatory, but we printed out maps of curvature, slope, aspect, and tangential curvature from our polyfitting surface routines.  Each one has the appropriate extension.

3. *Chi profile analysis*: we output a `csv` file which has all of the chi data for each channel, with the extension `_chi_data_map.csv`. You can load this into QGIS and see all of the data.  We also output a raster of all the extracted basins which is useful for checking if you got the minimum and maximum basin sizes correct, with the extension `_AllBasins.bil`.

=== Python scripts

We're also working on some python scripts for visualising the software.  This repository is messy and not very well ordered yet, but can be cloned https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools.git[here].
