== Introduction

One of the goals of *LSDTopoTools* is to automate processing of large volumes of topographic data. We have written a number of python sripts that help this automation process. 

=== Before you start

Our autmation scripts requre a variety of python packages. To ensure they actually work, you should install the *LSDTopoTools* pythn environment. Details for doing so live here: link:LSDTT_visualisation.html#_installing_the_lsdtopotools_python_toolchain
