== Preface by Author 1

You can write a preface here. This preface was written by https://github.com/simon-m-mudd[Simon Mudd], who also prepared this template. People like to read the preface when they are feeling tired and don't want to think about the technical stuff in the book. It is a good place to put some personal anecdotes, for example I wrote this section on https://lothianbuses.co.uk/timetables-and-maps/timetables/41[a bus].
