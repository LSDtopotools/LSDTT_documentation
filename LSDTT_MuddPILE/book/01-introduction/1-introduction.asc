== A parsimonious integrated landscape evolution model

Welcome to the documentation of MuddPILE, a simple landscape evolution model. The model is named MuddPILE because mudpile. Get it? But although Simon Mudd started the code it has a number of authors: Simon Mudd, James Jenkinson, Fiona Clubb and Declan Valters have all made contributions. 

The code is meant to be simple and fast. It simulates fluvial incision using the stream power law, and hillslope processes are simulated with either linear or nonlinear sediment flux laws. Both of these erosion modules use implicit schemes, and the model uses sparse matrix solvers for maximum computational efficiency.

=== What is MuddPILE?

MuddPILE is a very simple landscape evolution model that has fluvial erosion modelled with the stream power law (E = K A^m^ S^n^) and hillslope evolution modelled with a nonlinear sediment flux law, e.g., http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~kirchner/reprints/1999_29_Roering_nonlinear.pdf[Roering et al., 1999, JGR]. It uses the https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sean_Willett/publication/236741975_A_very_efficient_On_implicit_and_parallel_method_to_solve_the_stream_power_equation_governing_fluvial_incision_and_landscape_evolution/links/0046351932d6e86514000000.pdf[FASTSCAPE] algorithm to compute fluvial erosion, and I cooked up a relatively fast implicit method to solve the hillslope equations since they are nasty and nonlinear.  You can force the model with spatially heterogeneous uplift and erodibility. It runs fairly quickly. So if your goal is just to generate some fairly simple landscapes with some fairly simple rules fairly quickly this is the model for you.  

WARNING: MuddPILE is meant to explore the topographic outcomes of simple, virtual landscapes where there is competition between advective and diffusion-like processes, and *should not be used for predictive purposes*. Rather, the aim of this model is to see where landscape evolution models are inadequate for matching the topographic properties of real landscapes, which is why it is built within the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] framework. 

=== Your features are incomplete, why can't MuddPILE do [thing]?

*MuddPILE* was not designed as a general, flexible landscape evolution model. Many of those already exist. You can, for instance, try http://landlab.github.io/#/[landlab], http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:CHILD[CHILD], https://osur.univ-rennes1.fr/eros/[â‚¬ros], or https://sourceforge.net/projects/caesar-lisflood/[CAESAR]. *MuddPILE* was developed to run on our servers to meet the modelling needs of specific scientific papers. If you know pass:[c++] you can go into the `LSDRasterModel` object and make general models, but I'm afraid at the moment if you just want to run some simple models, the model driver (*MuddPILEdriver*) isn't particularly flexible. The main purpose for publishing this code is to make our simulations transparent and reproducible so that any simulation results reported in our papers can be easily recreated by other workers.
