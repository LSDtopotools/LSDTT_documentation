=== First example: a simple fluvial landscape. 

In this example we will make a very simple landscape using steady forcing and constant uplift. 

We call the program with:

[source,console]
----
$ ./MuddPILEdriver.out /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/MuddPILE/examples/basic_fluvial_landscape basic_fluvial.param
----

This will produce a number of rasters.

* The raster with `9999` in the filename is the initial raster after running the diamond square algorithm. the parabola, and roughening the surface.  
* The raster with `9998` is the raster after running some initial fluvial incision. 
* All other filenames are time slices that show the evolution of the landscape under steady forcing. 

You can look at these rasters using your favourite GIS (e.g., http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]), or you can look at them using our python tools. 

==== Python visualisation of the simple fluvial landscape

. Use conda to install the correct python enviroment: <<Using our python plotting tools, setting up python>>
. Clone the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[LSDMappingTools repository]. 
. Go to this repository in a *cmd.exe* (Windows) or terminal (Linux,MacOS) in your *HOST operating system*.
. Run the script `Create_hillshade_series_in_directory.py` from the repository. *YOU WILL NEED TO ADJUST THE DIRECTORY NAME TO SUIT YOUR DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND OPERATING SYSTEM*:
+
[source,console]
----
> python Create_hillshade_series_in_directory.py -dir C:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Git_projects\MuddPILE\examples\basic_fluvial_landscape\ -fname basic_fluvial -zmax 50
----
+
The `-dir` flag points to the data directory. The `-fname` flag points to the prefix of the rasters (before the numbers). The `-zmax` flag tells the plotting routine what the maximum elevation it is to plot in the colourbar. 
+
. This will create a timeseries of `.png` files. They look like this when stitched together. Note that the initial surface is a random fractal that has random noise superimposed so your landscape will look a bit different (but should have the same statistical properties):
