=== Third example: random uplift. 

In this example we simulate a fluvial-only landscape that is subject to random uplift rates. 

[source,console]
----
$ ./MuddPILEdriver.out /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/MuddPILE/examples/random_uplift random_uplift.param
----

Because this has no hillslope diffusion, the model should run quite quickly. Again, you will get a number of DEM outputs. To visualise, use:


[source,console]
----
> python Create_hillshade_series_in_directory.py -dir C:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Git_projects\MuddPILE\examples\random_uplift\ -fname random_uplift -zmax 80
----

Note that if you wanted to get a full record of all the uplift rates you would need to reduce the `print_interval` and use the `csv info` file to plot the uplift through time.
