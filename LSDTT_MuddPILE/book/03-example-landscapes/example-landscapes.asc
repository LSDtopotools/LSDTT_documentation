== Some example runs

In this section we will post a few example landscapes, along with how to get them running in *MuddPILE*.

=== Basic syntax of a *MuddPILEdriver* call

You should by now have *MuddPILEdriver* installed on your computer. If not, read this section: <<Installing MuddPILE>>.

. We will assume that you are working on our https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lsdtopotools/lsdtt_alpine_docker[Alpine docker container] (see installation instructions).
+
. In any call to *MuddPILEdriver*, you should have one terminal window open in the directory with the program, and one in the directory with the data. If you are using vagrant, you should use either `vagrant ssh` (in MacOS or Linux) or https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[putty.exe] to create two terminal windows. 
+
. The examples are in the *MuddPILE* repository. The easiest way to get them is to run:
+
[source,console]
----
# git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/MuddPILE.git
----
+
. Then navigate into the examples directory
+
[source,console]
----
# cd MuddPILE/examples
----


include::sections/example-01.asc[]

include::sections/example-02.asc[]

include::sections/example-03.asc[]

include::sections/example-04.asc[]

=== Next steps

Now that you have seen a few examples, you can go into the parameter file options and start playing around with different parameters. The next two chapters explain all the options available using the *MuddPILEdriver*.
