== Some example runs

In this section we will post a few example landscapes, along with how to get them running in *MuddPILE*.

=== Basic syntax of a *MuddPILEdriver* call

You should by now have *MuddPILEdriver* installed on your computer. If not, read this section: <<Installing MuddPILE>>.

. We will assume that you are working on our http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[vagrant setup], and that you have cloned the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/MuddPILE[MuddPILE repository] into `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects`.
+
. In any call to *MuddPILEdriver*, you should have one terminal window open in the directory with the program, and one in the directory with the data. If you are using vagrant, you should use either `vagrant ssh` (in MacOS or Linux) or https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[putty.exe] to create two terminal windows. 
+
. In the first terminal window, go to the directory with the code
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/MuddPILE/src/driver_functions
----
+
. You then call the program with two arguments: the data directory and the name of the driver function. The specific names of these for the examples will be shown in the example sections.

=== Next steps

Now that you have seen a few examples, you can go into the parameter file options and start playing around with different parameters. The next two chapters explain all the options available using the *MuddPILEdriver*.
