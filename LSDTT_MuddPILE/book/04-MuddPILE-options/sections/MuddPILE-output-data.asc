=== Output data formats

Data is written to rasters, csv files, or geojson file. 

* The rasters are all in ENVI `bil` format, which you can read about in the section: <<Preparing your data>>. 
+
IMPORTANT: ENVI bil should not be mistaken for ESRI bil. Make sure you are using ENVI bil format.

=== The different outputs and how to get them

To get the various outputs, you need to tell the *MuddPILEdriver* what you want using the parameter file. These tables tell you what flags to use and what data you will get. For *MuddPILE*, these options are rather limited: you just get a few elevation or hillshade rasters at the moment. 


==== Default file output

Any run you do will produce some standard files. The primary ones are the elevation rasters, but if you use the "normal" forcings, which here means anything after the spinup stage (see parameter file options for details), you will also get a `csv` file that contains information about the time steps. 

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
.These are basic files that are printed in more or less every run.

|Description

|*X.bil*
|The elevation rasters are `bil` files with a number (`X`) in the filename. The number is a time key. If you want to know what time these keys refer to look in the 


|*_model_info.csv*
|A comma seperated value file containing some information about the run. It has six columns: A frame number (this is the number in the filenames, it is used as a key for plotting function), the time in years, the `K` parameter (if spatially varying, reports minimum _K_), the _D_ parameter, the erosion rate (although this is veruy buggy at the moment and is not to be trusted), and the Max_uplift, which in the case of spatially varying _U_ reports the minimum uplift.

==== Optional raster output

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
.These are basic rasters that don't require chi analysis.

|Description

|write hillshade: true
|*_hs.bil*
|This prints a hillshade raster. Seems to give better results than hillshade functions in GIS software. Also much faster. Much of our plotting tools make nice looking maps when you drape hillshade over elevation data so we suggest you turn this on the first time you analyse a landscape. 

|print_fill_raster: true
|*_fill.bil*
|This prints the fill raster. Filling is computationally expensive so you can do this the first time you run a DEM and then use the `raster_is_filled` flag later to speed up computation. 

|spatially_varying_K: true
|*_KRaster.bil*
|If you use a spatially varying _K_ raster, it will print the raster with the extension *KRaster*.

|spatially_varying_U: true
|*_URaster.bil*
|If you use a spatially varying _U_ raster, it will print the raster with the extension *URaster*.
