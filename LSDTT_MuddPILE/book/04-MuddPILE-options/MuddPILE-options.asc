== MuddPILE details

*MuddPILE*, while not as flexible as, say, http://landlab.github.io/#/[Landlab], has some options. There are also a few different file output options. We list all the options in this chapter. Note that these are quite messy at the moment, since this is a beta version that has simply been used to run simulations for a forthcoming publication.
