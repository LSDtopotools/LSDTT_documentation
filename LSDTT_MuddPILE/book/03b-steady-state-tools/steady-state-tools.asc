== Steady state tools

*MuddPILE* includes a number of tools for taking a drainage network afrom existing topograhy and instantly madifying the elevations to obey a steady state (where uplift equals erosion) solution of the stream power law. 

.The stream power law
*********************************
The stream power law, first proposed by https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/94/6/739/202874/Channel-changes-in-badlands?redirectedFrom=fulltext[Howard and Kerby (1983)], is a very basic model of river incision. It simply states that erosion rate should be proportional to some function of both channel gradient and discharge. But we can't driectly measure discharge from digital topography so instead we use drainage area as a proxy for discharge. The form of the equation is _E = K A^m^ S^n^_. There is a lot of debate in the geomorphology community wheter or not this actually works (see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.3462[Lague, 2014]). It is clearly not correct in the details. But broadly it has been shown to be consistent with channel profiles and has been used in many context to intrpret river incision (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsg.2012.07.009[Kirby and Whipple, 2012]).
