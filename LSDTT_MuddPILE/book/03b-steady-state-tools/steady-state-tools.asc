== Steady state tools

*MuddPILE* includes a number of tools for taking a drainage network afrom existing topograhy and instantly madifying the elevations to obey a steady state (where uplift equals erosion) solution of the stream power law. 

.The stream power law
*********************************
The stream power law, first proposed by Howard and Kirby (1983), is a very basic model of river incision. It simply states that erosion rate should be proportional to some function of both channel gradient and discharge. But we can't driectly measure discharge from digital topography so instead we use drainage area as a proxy for discharge. The form of the equation is _E = K A^m^ S^n^_. There is a lot of debatre in the geomorphology community wheter orn not this actually work. It is clearly not correct in the details. But broadly it has been shown to be consistent
