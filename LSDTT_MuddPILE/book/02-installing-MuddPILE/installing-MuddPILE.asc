== Installing MuddPILE

We distribute MuddPILE as both pass:[c++] source code and as an exectuatlbe that you can run in one of our https://hub.docker.com/r/lsdtopotools/lsdtt_alpine_docker[docker containers]. The latter approach is easier to get started as long as you have docker on your computer. 

If you don't have https://www.docker.com/[Docker], then you will need to compile from source code. 

=== Use docker (Option 1)

. First, you need to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[install docker]

. Once you have docker installed, you can use our container:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -it -v C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_alpine_docker
----
+
Note that prior to the colon in this statement `C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools` you will need to put the path you an LSDTopoTools directory that you have made on your computer. This command: `-it -v C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools` tells the docker container to link directories on your computer to an `/LSDTopoTools` directory within the container. 
+
. You then need to run a startup script for `MuddPILE`. 
+
[source,console]
----
# sh MuddPILE_setup.sh
----
+
. Once you have done this, you can begin to use `MuddPILE`. 


=== Compile from source code (Option 2; only use if you don't have Docker)

WARNING: This method is not so easy if you don't know your way around a linux system. We suggest you use the docker instructions above instead. 

. First things first: you need to set up a Linux-like environment on your computer. 
.. If you have Linux, great! You just can jump right in!
.. If you have MacOS, great! MacOS is built on top of Linux!
.. If you have Windows, not as great! But Microsoft realized that lots of developers use Linux but wnted them to keep buying their operating system, so they have created something called the Windows inux Subsystem. To get that started, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[follow Microsoft's instructions]. 
+
. Okay, from now on I am assuming you are in a Linux-like environemnt. If you have never done this before, you might look at our link:LSDTT_installation.html[instructions about linux in this documentation]. 
+
. You will need a few tools first, so in you linux system grab `git` and a few other things:
+
[source,console]
----
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install -y git tzdata build-essential cmake libfftw3-dev
----
+
. Okay, that will take a little while, but after that, I suggest making a directory to hold LSDTopoTools somewhere, and then going into that directory. You will then need to grab the source code from the internet using `git`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/MuddPILE.git
----
+
. Before you compile the code, you need to decompress the http://www.boost.org/[boost] and http://www.simunova.com/mtl4[mtl4] libraries. We have packaged these up for you so our *MuddPILE* distribution is self-contained. To unzip, go into the `boost_mtl_minimal` directory and unzip using `tar`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd MuddPILE/boost_mtl_minimal
$ tar -xvzf boost_mtl_minimal.tar.gz
----
+
Unzipping this might take a while. Actually it takes quite a while. Note if you don't want `tar` to print all the information about the files being zipped use `tar -xzf` (the `v` flag is for `verbose`).
. Now, go into the /`src/driver_functions/` directory and make the program:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ../src/driver_functions
$ make -f MuddPILEdriver.make
----
+
. The result will be a program called `MuddPILEdriver.out`: this is the model! You can now run landscape evolution runs. Check back here for documentation on actually running the model (we hope to have documentation ready by end September 2017).
+
. You want this program to be in your path. You can do that with 
+
[source,console]
----
$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/MuddPILE/bin
----
+
You need to update `/path/to/MuddPILE` with your own path on your own computer. 

=== Visualisation

The output of MuddPILE is primarily raster files, in https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html[ENVI bil] format (*NOT ESRI BIL*), which can be read by GIS software such as http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS].

We have also developed a number of python tools for plotting *LSDTopoTools* and *MuddPILE* output. These are located in the repository https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[LSDMappingTools]. If you just want to run the model and look at the results, use QGIS or similar. You should really only use https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[LSDMappingTools] if you are using *LSDTopoTools* regularly.
