== Introduction to advanced hillslope analysis

.Basic hillslope metrics
**************************************
If you are looking for basic metrics like slope, curvature and aspect, you should follow the link below:

link:LSDTT_basic_usage.html[Basic topographic analyis in *LSDTopoTools*]
**************************************

In this document we will explore the analysis of hillslopes. The analyses here go beyond simple metrics like curvature and slope, and look at more subtle features of the landscape like channel length and dimensionless relief and curvature. We have used these metrics to understand both http://eps.berkeley.edu/~bill/papers/112.pdf[sediment flux laws] as well as the tectonic evolution of landscapes. 

.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below. 

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]

In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].

=== Background reading

If you wish to explore some background reading, a good place to look at how topography can be used to test theories about sediment transport is a series of papers by https://blogs.uoregon.edu/jroering/[Josh Roering] and colleagues:

* http://blogs.uoregon.edu/jroering/files/2014/11/2007RoeringReliefEPSL-13x5qn2.pdf[Roering, J.J., J.T. Perron, and J.W. Kirchner, (2007), Functional relationships between denudation and hillslope form and relief, _Earth and Planetary Science Letters_, *v. 264*, p. 245-258.]
* http://blogs.uoregon.edu/jroering/files/2014/11/2008RoeringHillslopeModelGSABull-23d6bjq.pdf[Roering, J.J., (2008), How well can hillslope evolution models ‘explain’ topography? Simulating soil transport and production with high-resolution topographic data, _Geological Society of America Bulletin_, *120*, p. 1248-1262.]

We used some of the concepts in those papers to show that ridgetop curvature was a useful metric to quantfy erosion rates as well as find signals of landscape transience:

To understand landscape transience, and also explore sediment flux laws, hillslope length must also be known, and we have developed methods for quantifying hillslope lengths and linking them to ridgetop curvature:
