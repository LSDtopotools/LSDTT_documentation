== Coupling hillslope and channel analysis


Hillslope erosion and the evolution of hillslope morphology though time is often driven by incision or deposition in channels. Tectonic signals can migrate upstream in channels in the form of knickpoints and knickzones, and as these pass the baes of a hillslope, the hillslope will begin to adjust from the base upwards. This can create complex spatial patterns in topographic metrics that may be used to decipher transient changes in the erosion of upland landscapes. 

We have developed a series of tools for quantifying the spatial correspondence between channel steepness and hillslope properties. 
Included in *LSDTopoTools2* is a program called *lsdtt-hillslope-channel-coupling*, which packages routines our group uses to detect coupled channel and hillslope evolution. 
The code is an extension of our packages for calculating pass:[E*] vs pass:[R*], used in a variety of publications. For background, see the papers below. 

Briefly, 
* pass:[E*] is a dimensionless curvature at the ridgetop, called pass:[E*] because it is closely related to the hillslope erosion rate. 
* pass:[R*] is a dimensionless relief, which is scaled by hillslope length.
