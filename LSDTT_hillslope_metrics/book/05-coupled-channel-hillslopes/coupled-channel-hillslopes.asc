== Coupling hillslope and channel analysis


Hillslope erosion and the evolution of hillslope morphology though time is often driven by incision or deposition in channels. Tectonic signals can migrate upstream in channels in the form of knickpoints and knickzones, and as these pass the baes of a hillslope, the hillslope will begin to adjust from the base upwards. This can create complex spatial patterns in topographic metrics that may be used to decipher transient changes in the erosion of upland landscapes. 

We have developed a series of tools for quantifying the spatial correspondence between channel steepness and hillslope properties. 
Included in *LSDTopoTools2* is a program called *lsdtt-hillslope-channel-coupling*, which packages routines our group uses to detect coupled channel and hillslope evolution. 

The code does a number of things. 

* It does basic analyses that replicates some of the functionality of `lsdtt-basic-metrics` and `lsdtt-chi-mapping` programs. In short, it can calculate surface fitting rasters such as slope, curvature and aspect, and it can extract the chi coordinate (a flow length normalised for drainage area).

* It extracts ridgelines from a DEM and has various algorithms for filtering thses ridgelines. It also has algoirthms for splitting ridgelines into segments to perform some spatial averaging if that is what the user want.
* It can perform hilltop flow routing, where flow routing is performed from the hilltops to either the channel, a floodplain, or a buffered channel network in order to link hilltop pixles to channel pixels. 
* It extracts basic channel networks and then can segment the channel network so that ridgetop pixels can be tagged against channel segments. 
* It then calculates a range of metrics associated with these hilltop traces. These include dimensionless relief (pass:[R*]), dimensionless curvature (pass:[E*]), and hillslope length. 

These metrics can tell you quite a lot about the state of the landscape and we feel quite strongly that combining the hillslope and channel metrics can yeild a much richer picture of a landscape's evolution than either channel or hillslope metrics alone. We very much hope that you will be able to apply these analysis tools to your own landscape. Below we provide some papers that can help you understand what the metrics mean.

=== Summary

By now you should be able to generate analysis that links hillslope and channel metrics.
