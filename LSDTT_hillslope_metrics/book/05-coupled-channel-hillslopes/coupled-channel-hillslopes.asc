== Coupling hillslope and channel analysis

Hillslope erosion and their evolution is often driven by incision or deposition in the channel at their base. Tectonic signals can migrate upstream in channels in the form of knickpoints and knickzones, and as these pass the bas of a hillslope, the hillslope will begin to adjust from the base upwards. This can create complex spatial patterns in topographic metrics that may be used to decipher transient changes in the erosion of upland landscapes. 

We have developed a series of tools for quantifying the spatial correspondence between channel steepness and hillslope properties. This chapter explains how to use these tools.

=== Summary

By now you should be able to generate analysis that links hillslope and channel metrics.
