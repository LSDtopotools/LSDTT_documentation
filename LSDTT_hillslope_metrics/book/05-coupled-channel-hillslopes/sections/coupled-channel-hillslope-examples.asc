=== First example: channel extraction

. Make sure you have set up `LSDTopoTools`. See installation instructions. 
. Navigate to the data directory (in docker, it is  `/LSDTopoTools/data/ExampleTopoDatasets/ChannelExtractionData/Guadalupe_1m`).

. First, you need to extract a channel network. 
. You can get channels in a number of way. If you use our link:LSDTT_channel_extraction.html#_the_channel_extraction_tool[channel extraction code] you can pick from a number of them. But we like something called the link:LSDTT_channel_extraction.html#_the_channel_extraction_tool[wiener method] best because it is both https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013WR015167[accurate] and https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/4/627/2016/[does not vary much as a function of grid resolution]. So this method is built in to the `lsdtt-hillslope-channel-coupling` tool. 
. To run the extraction, you should set the following flags:
+
.. As a brief note, to get a Wiener network, you set the parameter `print_wiener_channels: true`. 
.. You probably want to save the channel network and sources files, so set the following parameters: `print_channels_to_csv: true` and `print_sources_to_csv: true`. 
.. If you've done this before, you can load the sources file using the parameter `CHeads_file: filename.csv` where you replace `filename.csv` with the sources. 


=== Second Example

. Second, you should constrain the concavity index of the landscape. To do this use our link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html#_calculating_concavity[concavity index tool]. Note that there are three main options for selecting basins:
+
.. You can print a junction index raster and selects the junction numbers you want. This requires a junction file, which is a text file that simply lists the junction numbers you want, and you need to set the parameter `baselevel junctions fname: my_jncs.txt`. The text file can be a list of space or comma separated junctions.  
.. You can create a csv file that has latitude and longitude of the basin outlets. To get this to work set the paramters `get_basins_from_outlets: true` and `basin_outlet_csv: test_basins2.csv`. Natually you will need to adjust the name of the file. The file *MUST* have a column named `latitude` and a column named `longitude` and these must be in WGS84 coordinates. 
.. You can use the link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html#_selecting_channels_and_basins[basin selection options].
+
. Once you have a channel network and a concavity, link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html#_getting_the_software[extract the segmented channel profile]. You need to make sure the switches `print_segments: true` and `print_segments_raster: true` are included in the parameter file

. Once you have done all that, you should have a number of new files along with your original rasters. The ones needed for the channel-hillslope coupling are
+
* The channel heads file if you are using an extracted channel network (a `HEADS.csv` file) 
* A channel segments raster `_SEGMENTS.bil` that is derived from the run of *chi mapping tool* with the `print_segments: true` and `print_segments_raster: true` parameters in the parameter file. 
+
. These files are ingested by the code `lsdtt-hillslope-channel-coupling`, the instructions of which are below. 

==== Making spaghetti (i.e., doing the full analysis)

Wait, what is all this about spaghetti? One of the plots we make using the hillslope-channel analysis looks a bit like spaghetti, so we call these spaghetti plots. Hungry yet? It is better to run these analyses on a full stomach. 

.Quick reminder of LSDTopoTools2 installation
*****************************************************
If any of the below steps don't make sense, read the link:LSDTT_installation.html[full installation instructions].

. Pull and run the docker container `lsdtt_pcl_docker`
. Run the shell script to start *LSDTopoTools*:
+
[source,console]
----
# Start_LSDTT.sh
----
+
. You are ready to start analysing!
*****************************************************

Like all *LSDTopoTools2* code, you run the analysis with a parameter file. The format of these files is always the same. 

We will walk you though an analysis on a test site so you can see how it works. 

Please bear with us while we construct this documentation (SMM 20-June-2019).
