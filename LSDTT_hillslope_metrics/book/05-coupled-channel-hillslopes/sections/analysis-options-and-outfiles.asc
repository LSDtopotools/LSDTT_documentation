=== Coupled hillslope and channel ananylsis: options and outfiles

==== Output files

The two main output files are once called `_MChiSegmented.csv` and one called `_HilltopData.csv`. 

* `_MChiSegmented.csv`: This file is almost identical to the one produced using link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html#_point_data_usually_output_as_csv[channel steepness tools], execpt it has a final column with a `segment_number` that is used to link hilltops to channels. 
* `_HilltopData.csv`: This contains data from hillslope traces. These tend to be *very large*.
