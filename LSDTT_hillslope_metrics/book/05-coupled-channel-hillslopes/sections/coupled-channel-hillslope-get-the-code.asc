=== Obtaining the code and running analysis from coupled hillslope and channel analysis


The code is located in the repository *NEED REPO*.

Simply run:

[source,console]
----
$ make -f THEMAKEFILE
----

and you will be rewarded with a program called `THEPROGRAM.exe`.

Like almost all analyses packages in *LSDTopoTools*, this runs with a parameterfile. The typical call to the program will be:

[source,console]
----
$ ./chc.exe /path/to/paramfile name_of_paramfile.param
----
