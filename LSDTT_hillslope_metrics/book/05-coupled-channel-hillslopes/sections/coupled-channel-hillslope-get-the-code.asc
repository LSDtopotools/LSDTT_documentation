=== Getting *LSDTopoTools2*

The `lsdtt-hillslope-channel-coupling` program sits within *LSDTopoTools2*. 
You can link:LSDTT_installation.html[follow our installation instructions].

If you have installed *LSDTopoTools2* you will already have hillslope channel coupling routines, as well as the other programs necessary for carrying out the hillslope and channel analysis. 

=== Running the analysis

WARNING: This analysis is perhaps the most complex thing you can do with *LSDTopoTools*. It requires a number of different components to be pulled together for the final product, and it works in a few steps because you need the output of one step to set the parameters for the next steps. So please be patient. 

Here are the steps you need to follow:

. You need to extract the channel network. It is actually important to get a proper channel network rather than just using some threshold drainge area, because the analysis is more robust if you are comparing basins of similar order and you can't do that if you don't know where the channels begin.
. If you want, you can use that network to decide on the basins you want to explore. But you can also do that algorithmically. 
. You then need to determine the concavity of the channels because at some point you are going to calculate the steepness of the channels and for this you need a concavity. If you just need a first cut you can use 0.45, but we have tested for concavity in very many places and can assure you that it is highly variable. 
. Once you do those things you can then run the hillslope code. Be warned: this last step can take A VERY LONG TIME. 

=== Get the example data

. If you followed the installation instructions you will already have the example data. 
. It is in (int the docker container) `/LSDTopoTools/data/ExampleTopoDatasets/ChannelExtractionData/Guadalupe_1m`
