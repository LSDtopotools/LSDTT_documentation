.Before you start
*********************************************
Before you start you need to install *LSDTopoTools*. If you haven't done that, please follow the link below. 

link:LSDTT_installation.html[Instructions on how to install LSDTopoTools]


In addition, you will need to use some basic linux shell commands. If you have never done this before I suggest reading this brief introduction: link:LSDTT_using_linux.html[Basic use of the linux shell].

This document provides a user guide to use the Knickpoint Analysis method detail in a futur paper. At the moment I am just writing basic information for the coauthors to test it.

== The methodology

The method has several steps, which will be outlined below, here is a quick summary:

. $k_{sn}$ extraction based on Mudd et al., 2014 JGR.
. Total variation denoising from Condat., 2013 to isolate the main $k_{sn}$ variations.
. Grouping and quantification of ksn change.
. analysis of the segmented elevation to isolate the stepped changes using windowed statistics on it.



.Quick guide if you already know what you are doing
*****************************************************************************

Here is a quick overview of how to set up and run the code, if you have done it before:

. Choose the channel extraction method that you would like to use.
. Make sure your DEM is in `bil` format and is in the repository folder
. Create a parameter file for your DEM
. Make sure you have created a channel network for your DEM, and have the `csv` file in your repository, except if you want to use the generic drainage are threshold.
. Compile the code, `make -f chi_mapping_tool.make`. This step is only required once after any updates or fresh install.
. Create a parameter file `something.param` with the requested parameters.
. run the analysis: `./chi_mapping_tool.exe /path/to/the/param/ something.param`
. Open the resulting `bil` files in the GIS of your choice.
