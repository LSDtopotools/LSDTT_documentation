
== Overview

A decade ago it was very difficult to do basic scientific computation or even paper preparation without commercial software. Not only did this put up barriers to those at large universities that could afford commercial liscences, it also meant that a large fraction of science was done using commercial, closed source software. If you didn't have the liscence, you could not reproduce the analysis. 

This is no longer the case. Most of the the commercial tools commonly used by scientists have an open source alternative. In some cases (in our opinion) the open source alternative is better than the commercial alternative. 

In this document we will list the tools that we use in my group at the University of Edinburgh. The list is by no means exhaustive and we encourage readers to explore alternative lists (for example [XXXX]).
