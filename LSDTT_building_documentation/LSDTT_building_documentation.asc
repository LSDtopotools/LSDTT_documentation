== The LSDTopoTools documentation toolchain

Most users will just look at our website. But some users may wish to build the documents themselves. 
The documents are built using http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor], which is a https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby] documentation engine.  


== Some notes on installing Ruby for LSDTopoTools. 

After a number of painful windows installations, we have decided that life in linux is much easier. 
If you don't have linux you can make a little linux machine in your own computer using https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[virtualbox] and https://www.vagrantup.com/[vagrant], or using https://www.docker.com/[Docker]

. We will assume you are using Ubuntu in a Vagrant box or Docker container. We will use https://rvm.io/[rvm] to get everything working. 
. We need to install some software first:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install rvm
----
+
Then you need to logout of vagrant. It says that 
+
[source,console]
----
Creating group 'rvm'

Installing RVM to /usr/share/rvm/
Installation of RVM in /usr/share/rvm/ is almost complete:

  * First you need to add all users that will be using rvm to 'rvm' group,
    and logout - login again, anyone using rvm will be operating with `umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx`.

  * To start using RVM you need to run `source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh`
    in all your open shell windows, in rare cases you need to reopen all shell windows.
----
+
. So after running `vagrant halt` and `vagrant up`, do the command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh
----
+
. To see what users are in the group:
+
[source,console]
----
$ getent group rvm
----
+
. To add the vagrant user:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo usermod -a -G rvm vagrant
$ getent group rvm
----
+
. In my installation you cannot just start installing stuff, *you need to open a new terminal*. So use either `ssh` (linux or MacOS) or `putty.exe` (windows) to open a new terminal. 
+
. In your new terminal run (*Warning: this takes a long time!*):
+
[source,console]
----
$ rvm install 2.3
----
+
. I wanted to make sure we use this ruby default:
+
[source,console]
----
$ rvm use --default 2.3
----
+
. Then install bundler:
+
[source,console]
----
$ gem install bundler
----
+
. Now I went into a documentation folder and used `bundle install`. The gemfile is:
+
[source,ruby]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rake'
gem 'asciidoctor'

gem 'json'
gem 'awesome_print'

gem 'asciidoctor-epub3'
gem 'asciidoctor-pdf'

gem 'coderay'
gem 'pygments.rb'
gem 'thread_safe'
gem 'epubcheck'
----
+
. Yay, all the gems are installed! You can now compile our docs with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----

=== If you want to make pdf files using asciidoctor with equation in them

Forget about doing this in Windows. Follow the instructions above on getting https://rvm.io/[rvm] installed on Linux. 

. First, you need to install a bunch of stuff (this works in Ubuntu):
+
[source, console]
----
$ sudo apt-get -qq -y install bison flex libffi-dev libxml2-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev ttf-lyx
----
+
. Now run bundle install with this Gemfile:
+
[source,ruby]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rake'
gem 'asciidoctor'

gem 'json'
gem 'awesome_print'

gem 'asciidoctor-mathematical'
gem 'asciidoctor-epub3'
gem 'asciidoctor-pdf'

gem 'coderay'
gem 'pygments.rb'
gem 'thread_safe'
gem 'epubcheck'
----
+
. Now, this is annoying. To get the pdf to work, you need to designate an `:imagesoutdir:` but a *relative path will not work*. So you need an absolute path in your root `.asc` file. So, for example, the root `.asc` file should contain the directives:
+
[source,ascii]
----
:stem: latexmath
:imagesoutdir: /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/Documentation/images
----
+
. *You need to change this line to suit your path!*

== If you are a developer and want to get the documentation working

. The point of this template is to allow you to build a nice book that is easily converted to html. One nice place to host this website is https://github.com/[github]. These are instructions for starting your own book using the template, and setting it up as a github.io website. 
. The first thing you need to do is make a directory for your very own book. Lets call it `MyBook`. Go into `MyBook` and clone this template into a directory called master:
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir MyBook
$ cd MyBook
$ git clone https://github.com/simon-m-mudd/Book_template.git master
----
+
. Next, **delete** the `.git` directory inside the `master` directory.
. At this point you might want to rename some of the files and folders to suit your new book or website. If you forget to do this you can always change the names of files and directories by using the `git mv` command.
. Now use `git init` to start a new repository and then add and commit the files. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd master
$ git init 
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Added the files" .
----
+
. Now start a new repository on github **without a readme**. 
. It will give you the remote name. Add it to the repository:
+
[source,console]
----
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/MYUSERNAME/MYREPONAME.git
$ git push origin master
----
+
You will need to replace `MYUSERNAME` and `MYREPONAME` with the appropraite names. 
+
. Refresh the github repository page. You should see all the files from the template. 
. Now on the repository page, look above the files: you should see a tab for "Branches". 
Click on this and make a new branch called `gh-pages`.
+ Now go back into your terminal window, go down a level using `cd ..`, and clone the **gh-pages** branch. 
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd ..
$ git clone https://github.com/MYUSERNAME/MYREPONAME.git gh-pages
----
+
. Go into the gh-pages directory, check out the gh-pages branch, and delete the master branch (it will only delete the master branch form this directory). 
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd gh-pages
$ git checkout origin/gh-pages -b gh-pages
$ git branch -d master
----
. You gh-pages branch is still full of rubbish you don't need. Remove it all. Then make a dummy index page. 
+
[source, console]
----
$ git rm -rf .
$ echo "My Page" > index.html
$ git add index.html
$ git commit -m "Added the index" .
$ git push origin gh-pages
----
+
. Go back to the *master* folder and build the book:
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd ..
$ cd master
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----
+
WARNING: If you are on Windows and using *git bash*, it will not recognise Ruby commands, so you will need to open a separate powershell window to run the *bundle* command. This should not be a problem on Linux and MacOS.
+
. This will create a directory called *images* and an html file called *My_book.html*. 
+
. Rename *My_book.html* to *index.html* and copy it as well as the *images* directory into the *gh-pages* directory. 
+
. Now go back into the *gh-pages* directory, add the *images* directory, and then `commit` and `push` the changes (the below commands assume you are sitting in the `master` directory):
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd ..
$ cd gh-pages
$ git add images
$ git commit -m "Updated the website" .
$ git push origin gh-pages
----
+
IMPORTANT: You **MUST** push to the **gh-pages** branch!! When you work in the **master** directory you `push` and `pull` to the **master** branch, and when you work in the **gh-pages** folder you `push` and `pull` from the **gh-pages** branch! If you mess this up you might have some painful cleaning up to do. 
+
. Okay, you should now be able to look at your website on: http://MYUSERNAME.github.io/MYREPONAME, where `MYUSERNAME` is your github username and `MYREPONAME` is the name of the repo in which you stored your new book. 



== If you are making changes to the documentation

NOTE: You can ignore this unless you are helping write the template and have push permission. Currently this applies to nobody so they are more notes for myself to remember how I set up this repository. 

I do not want any messy merging conflicts! To avoid this please keep the *master* and *gh-pages* separate on your computer!

. When checking out the code, check them out into two directories:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDTopoTools/a_page.git master
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDTopoTools/a_page.git gh-pages
----
+
. In the gh-pages directory, check out the gh-pages branch and get rid of the master branch:
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd gh-pages
$ git checkout origin/gh-pages -b gh-pages
$ git branch -d master
----
+
. Now, go back to the master branch, you can make changes there. 

. When you commit changes to the master branch and you want to update the website, commit and push changes, then run bundle:
+
[source, console]
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/repo/book_template/master/
$ git commit -m "My latest commit" .
$ git push -u origin master
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----
+
. Now copy any new image files to the /images folder in the gh-pages branch (you will need to git add them), 
and rename *My_book.html* to *index.html* and copy to the gh-pages folder. 
+
[source, console]
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/repo/book_template/gh-pages/
$ cd images
$ git add <filenames of new images>
$ cd ..
$ git commit "updating website" .
----
+
. Now push the changes to the gh-pages branch
+
[source, console]
----
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----
+
[source, console]
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/repo/book_template/gh-pages/
$ git push -u origin gh-pages
----
