= LSDTopoTools Documentation

This is the master documentation for all of *LSDTopoTools*. 

It is organised into subfolders, each of which can be compiled by asciidoctor into an hml or pdf. 

If you have asciidoctor installed, you can use the python script `compile_LSDTTDocs.py` to build all the subfolders and place them in the html build folder.
