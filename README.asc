= LSDTopoTools Documentation

This is the master documentation for all of http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*], a topographic analysis package.

The main landing page of the documentation can be found here: https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/

This documentation has been written in http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] format, using the extended functionality of http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]. http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[Asciidoc] is similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[markdown] but we at *LSDTopoTools* like the added features of http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[asciidoc] and http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]. 

It is organised into subfolders, each of which can be compiled by http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] into an hml or pdf. 

== Getting asciidoctor to work

Please read our instructions on getting asciidoctor to work: https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_building_documentation.html

== Compiling all the documentation

We have made a python script that builds each section of the documentation and then copies the resulting images and `.html` files to the directory `html_build`. To run this script *you mush have asciidoctor installed*.

The python script is here: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_documentation/blob/master/compile_LSDTTDocs.py

Run the script with:

[source,console]
----
$ python compile_LSDTTDocs.py
----

This will build the entire website in `html_build` on your computer.
