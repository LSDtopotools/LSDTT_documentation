=== Adjusting point locations

Handheld https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System[GPS] units are often used in the field to determine location of sampling points. The accuracy of GPS measurements varies, and if you are working with a relatively high resolution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model[DEM] (e.g., 5 m resolution or better).

In this example we will look at some point data that was collected in a channel. We have extracted drainage area (using https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/[LSDTopoTools]), in the image below the channels are those with high drainage area and have purple colours:

In this image, you can see that the channel point locations are not all on the channel. THis is because the DEM has a pixel size of 5 metres and the error on the GPS unit is greater than 5 metres. Also, in some cases the channel routing algorithms, combined with a noisy DEM, route the channels to the wrong place. In addition, one of these points seems spurious (the one anomalously to the East), so we might remove it from the dataset. 

To edit the points, right click on the layer (not the csv file but a vector layer you created in <<Saving your imported data,previous steps>>) and select "toggle editing":

Once you do this the editing toolbar will become active:

You can then select the "node tool" to move nodes to the channel. You can also delete nodes.

You can either save or roll back edits (if you are unhappy with your work) by clicking on the icon with several pencils:

Once you are finished editing make sure you turn the editing back off using the "toggle editing" button.
