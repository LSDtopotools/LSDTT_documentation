=== Extracting data from a raster onto points

Another common operation is to extract raster data onto points. There is a handy tutorial about this already: http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/sampling_raster_data.html, but we are going to use the previous dataset here. 

First, you need to click on the *plugins* menu bar and select "manage and install plugins":

.Opening the plugins browser

Search for "point sampling tool" and install:

.Get the point sampling tool

Once you do that, the "point sampling tool" can be found under the plugins menu:

*****************************************************************
I have some bad news: the point sampling tool is very picky about the data you can use. Here are some gotchas:

. If you edited your vector file and deleted a point, it turns out that point is still there, but has a "NULL" data entry. The extract point tool does not like this one bit. It is very hard to get rid of these points in a shapefile. In a geojson file, you can open the file, delete the point with "null" in the line, and save the file. 
. All of the layers need to be in the same projection. Because raster layers take up a lot of space you should check on your raster's projection and then save your vector data in that same projection. Right click on the layer, select "save as" and then on the CRS button select the same projection as your raster.

Select the layer from which to extract data, and use the "browse" button to save the file. In addition, I recommend keeping all of the data in the original vector file:

NOTE: The point extraction tool can only save files as ESRI shapefiles. 

You can then right click on the new layer, view the attribute table and copy the data into a clipboard:

This can then be pasted into a spreadsheet.
