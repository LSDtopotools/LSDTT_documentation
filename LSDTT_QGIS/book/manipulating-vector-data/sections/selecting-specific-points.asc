=== Selecting specific points

In this example we will load some data from csv and then select a subset of these points. 

The data we will load comes from a http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/full[chi analysis] of a small Scottish catchement using https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/#_running_a_chi_analysis[LSDTopoTools]. Note, chi is a Greek letter pronounced "kai".

First, we <<Importing the data into QGIS,import the csv data>>. You should get something that looks a bit like this:

.A chi network derived from LSDTopoTools

Now, suppose we only want a subset of these data. How do we extract them? 

. First, select the "select features by freehand" icon on the *attributes toolbar* (if this toolbar is missing, right click near the top of the QGIS window and activate it):
+
.Select features by freehand

+
. Then, select the points you want:

.Select the points you want

+
. Right click on the layer, and then choose "save as". On the "save as" menu, make sure you select the option to "Save only selected features". In this case I am exporting a shapefile since I want access to the underlying data. 
+
.Saving the selected features as a shapefile

+
NOTE: You can also save as a csv file to just get the selected values. If you only want to plot, say, a river profile of selected points this can come in handy. 
+
. Great! Now you can make new files that include just a subset of your initial data.
