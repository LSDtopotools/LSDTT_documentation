== Preface by Simon Mudd

This is a collection of notes on simple operations within http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]. It stems from a http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxgegr10094.htm[course at Edinburgh] where the topic is http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/what-geomorphology-0[Geomorphology] but for the course project students need to analyse topographic data. This is not meant to be a course on QGIS! However if you are just looking to get started with the very basics you might find it helpful.

This document is part of a family of documents on topographic analysis using http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[*LSDTopoTools*]; you can migrate back to the main landing page link:index.html[by clicking this link].
