=== What are coordinate systems?

Coordinate systems are simply reference frames for describing position. All geographic data must be placed in a coordinate system. Over the years, cartographers have developed numerous systems so now whenever we collect geographic data there are a myriad of choices when it comes to selecting a coordinate system. A full description can be http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisengine/dotnet/89b720a5-7339-44b0-8b58-0f5bf2843393.htm[found on the ESRI website], so here we will stick to the basics. 

Firstly, a coordinate system can fall into two categories:

* **A geographic coordinate system** which uses spherical coordinates. Latitude and longitude are the most familiar measures of such a coordinate system since these give locations on the surface of a sphere. The units of geographic coordinate systems are angular units (e.g., degrees).  
* **A projected coordinate system** projects your data, collected from the surface of a sphere, onto a flat surface. National grids (like the British National Grid) tend to be in projected coordinates: they measure locations in distances (e.g., metres from a reference location, sometimes reported on easting and northing).

There are many, many different coordinate systems. For example, in the United States there are 124 (!!) local coordinate systems called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Plane_Coordinate_System[State planes]. Most countries have their own coordinate system. There are also global coordinate systems.
