[appendix]
== Projections and transformations

We live on the surface of a planet, Earth, that is almost a perfect sphere. Our computer screens and sheets of paper are flat. This causes all sorts of problems. The problems are addressed by using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection[map projections]. I am afraid if you use geographic data you will have to deal with projections, which, unless you are a cartographer, will be tedious and frustrating. Hopefully this appendix will help you understand how to appropriately manage projections within QGIS and other environments.
