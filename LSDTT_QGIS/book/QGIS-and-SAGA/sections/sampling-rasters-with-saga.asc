=== Sampling rasters with the SAGA toolkit

. Okay, now we have some valley depth data! Lets add that to our channel width data.
+
. Actually, we need to do something first. SAGA outputs data in its own idosyncratic data format that is badly georeferenced. So when you try to do subsequent analysis it might break things. For point extraction, it is *essential* that the data layers are in the same projection. 
+
.. First, export the valley depth raster:
+
.Export the SAGA layer to a different file format

+
.. In this particular case, the main raster (`WA.bil`) is in UTM zone 30 (`EPSG:32630`) so put the new DEM in this coordinate system:
+
.Ensure you have the same eoreferencing as the base DEM

+
. Okay, you should also save the csv data as a shapefile, and it is probably clever to put it in this same coordinate system  (do the same thing: right click on the data layer and use export tool).
+
WARNING: This tool is very sensitive to coordinate systems. It will not like it if any of your data is in a different coordinate system. So make sure that all your layers are projected in the same way!
+
. Now we can move on to the SAGA option for sampling rasters.

+
. When you do this make sure to add the grids that you want to sample. It looks like you can add loads of rasters! Unfortunately, testing suggest it will only actually add one raster at a time. Note that each layer has its projection listed. *You should only choose layers with the same EPSG code.*

. Also make sure to save the output. And make sure you sample using either `bilinear` or `cubic`:

+
. You will get a points layer in the same location, but if you look at the data by right clicking on the layer and opening the attribute table:

You will then see the raster data in a table:

. You can export this to an excel spreadsheet or csv if you wish.
