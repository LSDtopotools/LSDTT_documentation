=== Using the SAGA toolkit to process raster and other data

. Now that we have a DEM (`WA.bil`) and some point data (that you imported with the last step), we are going to import some data using something called the http://www.saga-gis.org/en/index.html[SAGA toolkit]. This contains a range of GIS functions embedded in QGIS. 
+
. To get to the toolkit, use the `Processing->toolkits` menu button in QGIS:

. Once you do this, you will get a huge number of options:

. There are loads of SAGA options. Lets use the `valley depth` option:

. Save the valley depth as a file in the same directory as your DEM

+
. Running this routine will take some time. You can only save this as a articular SAGA file. 
+
. You will end up with some data that looks like this:
