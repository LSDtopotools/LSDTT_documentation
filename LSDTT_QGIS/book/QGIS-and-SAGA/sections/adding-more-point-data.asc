=== Adding a bit more data

. In this example we will add some data that is recorded as a csv in the British National Grid.

. Here is the data (in comma separated value, csv, format):

. You can copy this into excel, and then use the text import wizard. Select "delimited" in the second window and delimit the data with a comma. You can then save this file as a csv file.

. See the <<Import point data from text or spreadsheet,instructions for importing a csv>>

. Open QGIS and load the raster. The new raster is in the same directory with your other data and is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`. To load raster data in QGIS follow these instructions: <<Adding raster data>>. The data will look like this:
+
.A hillshade of the Whiteadder catchement

+
. As you can see, the DEM has quite a few artifacts. There isn't much we can do about that, I'm afraid.
