=== Adding a bit more data

. First, find the example data (`WA.bil`) and add it to QGIS

+
. Now we will add some data that is recorded as a csv in the British National Grid.

. Here is the data (in comma separated value, csv, format):

. You can copy this into excel, and then use the text import wizard. Select "delimited" in the second window and delimit the data with a comma. You can then save this file as a csv file. 
+
. Now, import the data into QGIS using the `Layer -> add layer -> add delimited text` option. See the <<Import point data from text or spreadsheet,instructions for importing a csv>>. The data is in british national grid coordinates (https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/osgb-1936-british-national-grid/[EPSG:27700]). Make sure that the X any Y coordinates are the `Easting` and `Northing` columns. False easting and false northing are the data spit out by a GPS in Britain. An explanation of why that is can be found << A special case: GPS coordinates and the British National Grid,earlier in this section>>.

. The data should look like this:

. Okay, you are ready to move on to the next step.
