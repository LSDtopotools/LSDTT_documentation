== More QGIS analysis using SAGA tools

We will continue working with data using the http://www.saga-gis.org/[SAGA GIS] tools that are embedded within QGIS. 

We will add some data (more csv data, to give you more practise) and then look at subsampling this using a few new data layers. 

=== First step: get topographic data

. Before we begin, you will need some topographic data. 
. If you have link:[installed LSDTopoTools], you will already have the data: it is called `WA.bil`, and is a DEM, from the Ordnance Survey, in a small catchment in the Lammermuir hills of Scotland.
. If you haven't got that data, go to this website: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/SmallExampleTopoDatasets
.. Click on the `clone or download` link, and download and unzip. 
.. The relevant data is in the subdirectory `BasicMetricsData`.

=== Summary

You now should have some familiarity with the SAGA GIS tools within QGIS and should feel confident to explore the options.
