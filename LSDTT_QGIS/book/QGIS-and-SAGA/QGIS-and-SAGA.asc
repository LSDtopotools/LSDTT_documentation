== More QGIS analysis using SAGA tools

We will continue working with data using the http://www.saga-gis.org/[SAGA GIS] tools that are embedded within QGIS. 

We will add some data (more csv data, to give you more practise) and then look at subsampling this using a few new data layers. 

=== First step: get topographic data

Before we begin, you will need some topographic data.

=== Summary

You now should have some familiarity with the SAGA GIS tools within QGIS and should feel confident to explore the options.
