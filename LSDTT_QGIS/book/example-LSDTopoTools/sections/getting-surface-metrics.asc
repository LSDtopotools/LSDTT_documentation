=== Getting surface metrics

. The second example generated a number of surface fitting rasters. These all have `_secondexample_` in the filename. 
+ 
. In this case the program is printing *slope*, *aspect*, *curvature*, and *tangential curvature* rasters. They have filenames that reflect their contents so have a look. Slope tells you how steep the landscape is, aspect which direction the surface is pointing, curvature how, uh, curvy the landscape is (mathematically it is how quickly slope changes in space) and the tangential curvature is how curvy the landscape is in the direction of steepest descent. Essentially tangential curvature tells you how tightly curved contours are and is useful for finding valleys. 
+
. The way these are calculated is by fitting a surface of radius `surface_fitting_radius` to the points in the DEM and then calculating derivatives of that surface. 
+
. Load these into QGIS.

==== Questions and tasks for surface metrics

* Try changing the `surface_fitting_radius` using `lsdtt-basic-metrics`. What happens?
