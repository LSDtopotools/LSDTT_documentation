=== Generating the data

Okay, I am afraid this is something of a bait and switch: we are going to generate data using *LSDTopoTools* and to do that you need to follow the instructions for link:LSDTT_basic_usage.html[basic LSDTopoTools usage]. 

At the end of that excercise you should

* Have *LSDTopoTools* installed.
* Be able to get into a linux environment (using University of Edinburgh servers and MobaXterm, or using Docker on your own computer).
* Have run the initial `lsdtt-basic-metrics` commands from the examples. 

.A few linux shortcuts
********************************************
`pwd`   -- Tells you what directory you are currently in.

`cd`    -- change directory. You need to give it the directory name.

`cd ..` -- go up a directory.

`ls`    -- list what is in the directory.

`mkdir` -- make a new directory.

`wget`  -- download a file from the internet. Needs to be followed by an html/ftp address.

==== What data should you have and where is it? 

After running the link:LSDTT_basic_usage.html[basic LSDTopoTools usage], you will have a bunch of datasets within a directory called `LSDTT_workshop_data`. If you followed the instructions it will be inside a directory called `LSDTopoTools`. 

* In your host operating system (e.g., the Windows computer in the Edinburgh computer labs and not the Linux machine you have accessed through MobaXterm), use your file explorer to find all these files. 
* We are going to look at these using QGIS.
