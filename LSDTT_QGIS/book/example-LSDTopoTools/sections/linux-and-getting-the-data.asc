=== Getting the data in linux

The data for this excercise https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data[lives online] and you could download it by clicking on it. But we are going to get the data from command line in a linux environment as a gentle introduction.

These instructions have been designed for students at the Unviversity of Edinburgh but if you want to try them outside of the Edinburgh computing environment you should http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[read our instructions about how to set up a linux environment on your home computer, regardless of its operating system].

. The first thing you need to do is log into a linux server.
+
* At Edinburgh, the computer labs should all have http://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/intranet/it/linux-servers/nx[nx] installed. Use it to log into the GeoScience servers. 
* Outside Edinburgh, you use https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[putty.exe] (windows) or ssh (MacOS or Linux) to get into a http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[vagrant LSDTopoTools box].
+
. If you are at Edinburgh, you need to make a terminal window in the *nx* desktop. All you do is *right-click* and select *open terminal window*.
+
. To see where you are, type `pwd` in the command line:
+
[source,console]
----
$ pwd

.A very brief overview of linux commands
********************************************
`pwd`   -- Tells you what directory you are currently in.

`cd`    -- change directory. You need to give it the directory name.

`cd ..` -- go up a directory.

`ls`    -- list what is in the directory.

`mkdir` -- make a new directory.

`wget`  -- download a file from the internet. Needs to be followed by an html/ftp address.
********************************************
+
. You can use `cd` and `cd ..` to move around. When you have found a good place to put your data get it using `wget`. Make sure to copy these commands and enter them one line at a time.:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data/master/WA.hdr
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data/master/WA.bil
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data/master/WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data/master/WA_BasicMetrics02.driver
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data/master/WA_BasicMetrics03.driver
----
+
Type `ls` after you have done that to see if you've got the files. 
+
. Now type `pwd`. *THIS TELLS YOU WHERE YOUR DATA IS!* You need to copy this directory! In you terminal, if you highlight the text linux will automatically copy this data
+
.Highlight in a terminal and the highlighted text will be copied to the clipboard.

Save that directory somewhere (like  text file) you can find it again later.
