=== A first basic analysis

This first example is extremely simple but it will introduce you to calling *LSDTopoTools* programs.

All *LSDTopoTools* programs are called from a terminal window. They read a file, which we call either a *parameter* or *driver* file which tell the program what to do. When you call the program, you need to tell it where this driver file is. You do this by telling the program the directory in which the *driver* file is located, and the name of the *driver* file. 

The *LSDTopoTools* program we will be using is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out`. 

. We have put this program online. There are three different versions, since it has been compiled for a few different linux environments:
+
* If you are at Edinburgh, the program is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out`. It works on Scientific Linux 7.
* If you are using our vagrant 32 bit ubuntu system, the program is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics_U64.out`.
* If you are using our vagrant 64 bit ubuntu system, the program is called `LSDTT_BasicMetrics_U32.out`.
+
. Get the version for your operating system. For example, if you are using the Edinburgh servers, get it with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data/master/LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out
----
+
. Use `ls` to make sure this program and all the data you downloaded from the last section is in the same folder. It should look like this:
+
[source,console]
----
smudd@burn practical_02 $ ls
LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out    WA_BasicMetrics02.driver  WA.bil
WA_BasicMetrics01.driver  WA_BasicMetrics03.driver  WA.hdr
smudd@burn practical_02 $ 
----

==== The driver file for the first analysis

. Before we run the program we need to modify the driver file. The first driver file looks like this:
+
[source,paramfile]
----
# Parameters for extracting simple surface metrics
# Comments are preceeded by the hash symbol
# Documentation can be found here: 
# https://simon-m-mudd.github.io/QGIS_book/#_an_example_using_data_from_lsdtopotools

# These are parameters for the file i/o
# IMPORTANT: You MUST make the write directory: the code will not work if it doens't exist. 
read path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data
write path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data
read fname: WA
write fname: WA_FirstExample
channel heads fname: NULL

# The data that you want printed to file
write_hillshade: true
----
+
. You need to be able to edit this file. You should edit it in your host operating system (e.g. not via a terminal or nx, but rather in Windows or MacOS). In the Edinburgh compouter labs there is a text editor called *PSPad*. You can open that program and drag text files into it and edit them. **Do not use Wordpad or Word!! They insert all kinds of formatting and change the filenames and will, in general, mess everything up!*
+
. We need to ensure that the *driver* functions point to the correct data. Copy the location of the data by using the `pwd` command (see last section), and paste that in to these lines (*YOUR DIRECTORY WILL NOT BE THE SAME, USE `pwd` TO FIND THE CORRECT DIRECTORY*):
+
[source,paramfile]
----
read path: /home/smudd/courses/Eroding_landscapes/2017/practicals/practical_02
write path: /home/smudd/courses/Eroding_landscapes/2017/practicals/practical_02
----
+
NOTE: The *must* be a space after the `:` character. 
+
. Now we are going to run the program. We run it in a terminal window like this (make sure you are in the directory with the data):
+
[source,console]
----
$ chmod 744 LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out
$ ./LSDTT_BasicMetrics.out /home/smudd/courses/Eroding_landscapes/2017/practicals/practical_02 WA_BasicMetrics01.driver
----
+
The first command (`chmod`) is there just to give you permission to execute the program. The second is the actual program call. *You will need to modify the directory to be the one that contains your data!*
+
. If you had all the directory names correct, you will get some text to screen that ends with a statement about hillshading. In fact all this does is print a hillshade of the raster. 
+
. Open QGIS and load the raster. The new raster is in the same directory with your other data and is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`. To load raster data in QGIS follow these instructions: <<Adding raster data>>. The data will look like this:
+
.A hillshade of the Whiteadder catchement
image::images/WA_HS.jpg[Whiteadder hillshade]
+
. As you can see, the DEM has quite a few artifacts. There isn't much we can do about that, I'm afraid.
