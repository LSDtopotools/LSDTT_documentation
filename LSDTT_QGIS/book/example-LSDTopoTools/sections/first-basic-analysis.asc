=== A first basic analysis

. In the first example you generated a hillshade. 

. Open QGIS and load the raster. The new raster is in the same directory with your other data and is called `WA_FirstExample_hs.bil`. To load raster data in QGIS follow these instructions: <<Adding raster data>>. The data will look like this:
+
.A hillshade of the Whiteadder catchement
image::images/WA_HS.jpg[Whiteadder hillshade]
+
. As you can see, the DEM has quite a few artifacts. There isn't much we can do about that, I'm afraid.
