=== Import point data from text or spreadsheet

In many situations you might collect data in the field using a GPS, or get data from some other software (e.g., https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools]) that is not in a standard vector format. As long as the data has some spatial coordinates, you should be able to import it into QGIS. QGIS can read various formats but you will help yourself if you prepare your data in a common data format. Here we will describe importing data from either a spreadsheet (e.g., an *.xlsx* file) or a comma separated value file (*.csv*). One difference between ArcMap and QGIS is that ArcMap can import Excel files directly whereas in QGIS you need to convert to csv.  

==== Preparing your text data or spreadsheet

These instructions refer to point data. Making polygons and lines requires information about how points are connected so we will not discuss that at this stage. For point data the key thing is to know where the points are! In the most common case one has collected data using a GPS, and written them down somewhere. We need to get these data into QGIS.

As we will see momentarily, QGIS asks for the *X Field* and *Y Field*. What these are will depend on the *projection* of your data. 

IMPORTANT: If you are using a GPS you need to know what in which coordinate system the GPS reports its data. Make sure you check the settings of your GPS before you start collecting data so you know the coordinate system. If you fail to do this and the data is in latitude and longitude it is usually okay to assume the coordinates are in WGS84. 

==== Geographic coordinates

* If the coordinate system is *geographic* you will get latitude and longitude. This can be a little confusing because we often talk about x and y coordinates or latitude and longitude in that order, but in a sense these orders are reversed:
** The latitude is the *Y Field*
** The longitude is the *X Field* 
* If you get latitude and longitude, you might get them in degrees, minutes and seconds (e.g., 3Â° 10` 22``). I am afraid QGIS doesn't really like this. You will need to convert to *decimal degrees* (e.g., 3.1727778). There are online converters for this. You can also just copy the coordinates in google maps and it will spit out the coordinates in decimal degrees. 

==== Projected coordinates

* If the coordinate system is *projected*, your data will either be in *X*, *Y* coordinates or *Easting* and *Northing*. 
** *Easting* is the *X Field*
** *Northing* is the *Y Field*

==== Preparing the actual data in a spreadsheet

. All you need to do is put your X and Y data in separate columns, and then have additional columns for the associated data. Here are two examples:
+
.Data in a spreadsheet with latitude and longitude coordinates 
image::images/excel_lat_long.jpg[Spreadsheet data with latitude and longitude]
+
.Data in a spreadsheet with easting and northing
image::images/excel_east_north.jpg[Spreadsheet data with easting and northing]
+
. Hopefully you get the idea: you always need two columns for location data.
+
. Now, you need to save spreadsheet data as a `csv` file (ArcMap can import `xlsx` or `xls` files directly but in QGIS it is easier to convert to `csv`). Simply take your spreadsheet and `save as` a `csv` file:
+
.Save spreadsheet as csv
image::images/save_as_csv.jpg[Save as csv]
+
. Once you've done this you can move on to the import data stage. 


==== Preparing the actual data in a comma separated value (csv) file

A comma separated value file (csv) is just a text file that has values separated by commas. It does what it says on the tin. You can save any Excel worksheet as a `csv` file (see above). The advantage of `csv` files is that you don't need Excel to read the data: you can read it with any text editor. However `csv` files only contain the values: you can't save graphs or formatting. If you want separate worksheets you need to save them as separate files. The second example above in csv format look like this:

[source,csv]
----
easting,northing,gremlins,temperature
124061,66412,0,7.221
124135,66418,12,5.432
124137,66477,6,4
----


==== A special case: GPS coordinates and the British National Grid

The https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/support/the-national-grid.html[British National Grid] has a system of referencing that mixes letters and numbers, following the long British tradition of conceiving systems that are inscrutable to outsiders. 

When you set your GPS to British National Grid, it will spit out some numbers but also some letters. For example, you might get something like *NT 51422 13172*.
QGIS and other GIS systems only want numbers. How do we turn these letters into numbers?

The answers is that we need to count boxes along the grid, shown below:

.Ordnance survey grid
image::images/os-grid.jpg[The OS grid]

You need to add a digit to the front of your coordinates based on the letters. Each row and column represents a digit, and these are counted from the bottom left corner. The first row and column begin with digit 0, then next 1, and so on. The coordinate *NT* is in the 4th column and 7th row, but the first row and column are zero, so you put a 3 and 6 in front of the coordinates:

*NT 51422 13172* -> *351422, 613172*

==== Another special case: csv data from LSDTopoTools

http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] is a software package developed at the University of Edinburgh School of GeoScience for topographic analysis (if you want to use it, https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/[start here]). A number of its analysis routines create csv data. These data contain latitude and longitude coordiantes: these coordinates are **in a WGS84 projection, http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/[EPSG:4326]**. When you import csv data from http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] make sure your projections is *EPSG:4326*.

=== Importing the data into QGIS

One you have organised your data, you can import it using the menus:

Layer->Add layer->Add Delimited Text Layer

.Adding delimited layer
image::images/Import_text_data.jpg[QGIS add text data]

Once you select the *Add delimited text layer* option, you will get a dialog box asking to upload a file:

.Add text layer dialog
image::images/create_layer_dialog.jpg[QGIS add text data dialog]

If you select the *csv* file you will see that many of the fields are selected for you automatically:

.Add text once you have selected the file
image::images/create_layer_dialog_file_selected.jpg[QGIS add text data dialog]

IMPORTANT: You need to check on the *X Field* and *Y Field* entries to make sure that they are correct!

IMPORTANT: Another gotcha is that when loading a csv file you must select *csv file format* just below where you select the file. 

Okay, nearly there!! Once you hit okay, you will need to select the coordinate system. 

==== Selecting the coordinate system

This deserves its own header since it is so important. If you don't choose the correct coordinate system, your data will be in the wrong place!! This is what the dialog looks like:

.Selecting a coordinate system
image::images/select_coordinate_system.jpg[QGIS select coordinate system]

In the image above, I have used the filter tool to select the WGS84 UTM 30N zone (this happens to be the zone for Scotland and much of western Europe). I found it using the EPSG code. Some common EPSG codes are listed <<Common EPSG codes,in this table>>, and you can search for codes here: http://www.spatialreference.org/.

=== Saving your imported data

You can keep your data in csv format, but if you do that, you will need to import it each time you want to look at it. It is probably better to save it in a vector file format. Find the layer in the layers panel (in this example I have a layer called "Channel_width"), and right click on it. Then choose "save as":

.Saving imported data
image::images/save_as_right_click.jpg[Get save as with right click]


Once you have clicked "save as", you will get this dialog box:


.The dialog box for saving in vector format
image::images/save_as_dialog.jpg[Save as dialog box]

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile[ESRI shapefile] format is the default. This format can be read by a number of different software packages and is a safe choice. The drawback is that it generates many different files. Another option is the http://geojson.org/[GeoJSON] format, which is frequently used in web mapping applications. We recommend using one of these two formats. 

WARNING: QGIS is a bit picky about the file names when you save the file; you should use the "browse" dialog and name the file there rather than just typing a name. 

You should notice that the new file has appeared in the layers dialog:

.Your brand new vector data as a layer
image::images/new_layer.jpg[New layer]

You can now right click on the old layer (which is just csv data) and remove it. Note if you just want to zoom in on just your imported data, you can right click on the layer and select "zoom to layer":

.Right click on a layer to zoom to its extent
