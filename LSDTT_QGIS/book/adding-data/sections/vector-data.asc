=== Adding vector data

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats#Vector[Vector data], in a GIS, refers to a family of different types of data including points, lines, polylines, and polygons. The data are made up of points (sometimes called "vertices") that have specific locations. Unlike in a raster, these points do not need to be regularly spaced. There are a number of different varieties of vector data, the most common being ESRI shapefiles. A list of QGIS compatible formats can be found on the https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/supported_data.html[QGIS documentation website].

To add vector data, you need to click on the part of the *manage layers toolbar* that looks like a series of points connected by lines:

In newer versions of QGIS there is a single "add data" button that you can use.
