=== Adding raster data

To add raster data you need to click on the part of the *manage layers toolbar* that looks like a checkerboard:

There are enormous numbers of http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html[raster file formats]. These can broadly be broken into these categories:

* Rasters that consist of only one file, such as the *GeoTiff* format. Just select that one file and off you go! 
* Rasters that have two or more files. One file holds the data and the other files hold some extra information like the projection (often in a *.prj* file) and header information (often in a *.hdr* file). The different files will all have the same prefix (e.g., WAWater.bil, WAWater.hdr, WAWater.prj). You need to select the big file that holds all the data. 
* Rasters that are made up of folders. The http://www.esri.com/[ESRI] native format is like this, because ESRI evidently loves to make things difficult and impenetrable. Somewhere deep in one of these folders will be a large file called something like *w001001.adf*. You need to open that one. Why does it have such a stupid name? Only ESRI knows. There is probably a text file from 1980 sitting in a server in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlands,_California[Redlands, CA] that explains how stupid filenames are part of the http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/[ArcMap] business model.  

*IF* the raster layer has information about its https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection[projection], then the layer will just pop up in both your *layer panel* and your *map canvas*. 

If the raster layer doesn't have this information you will need to assign a projection. If you don't know what the projection is, I am afraid I cannot help you: it is your data! If you do know what the projection should be, probably the best way to search for it is by finding its EPSG number using a search engine and then enter that in the projection search (you should see a *filter* box).
