== Adding data

This chapter details the basics of adding data to QGIS. Before you add any data, you should know that geographic data comes in two basic flavours: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_data[raster] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics[vector] data. 

* Raster data is built on a regular grid. It has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel[pixels] that contain different values. If the raster data has "bands" it just means that there are multiple values assigned to each pixel. The most common version of raster bands is for image data that has a red, green and blue band (RGB). 
* Vector data, in a GIS context, actually means a number of related data types that contain locations at specific points. So points, lines or polylines, and polygons are all considered vector data. You can read about the differences here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats#Vector_formats

For each of these two data types, there are many different file formats that QGIS can read. If you want to read about them the QGIS documentation has lists for  https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/supported_data.html[supported vector] file formats, and for rasters QGIS supports anything supported by another bit of software called http://www.gdal.org/[GDAL]: here is the list of http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html[supported raster formats]. In the following sections we will very briefly explain how to import these data into QGIS.
