== Background and Motivation

http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS] is a free and open source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system[Geographic Information System] (GIS). This book contains instructions on how to perform basic operations within http://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]. It is not meant to be a QGIS course, but rather should get you started if you just want to look at some data. 

If you want to actually gain a deeper understanding of QGIS there are many excellent resources:

* http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/learning_resources.html A curated collection of QGIS learning resources
* http://qgis-tutorials.mangomap.com/ A series of brief videos explaining simple QGIS tasks 
* http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/3651/where-to-find-qgis-tutorials-and-web-resources Another list of QGIS resources. 

In addition, QGIS now has a large, active and growing user community and if you type in a question about QGIS into a search engine you are almost certain to find a solution to your problem. 

So, with all of these fantastic resources, why, you ask, am I writing these notes? In short, my students need to do a very specific subset of GIS tasks; these tasks are explained here. Hopefully the result is more efficient then sending many students separately to the myriad of QGIS websites. 

=== The QGIS version used for this book

We use the long term release (LTE) version of QGIS 2.14 (Essen): http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

=== Basic QGIS layout

When you load QGIS you will see a bunch of toolbars and panels. This brief section describes a few of the key elements. If you want more detail see the QGIS documentation: https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/training_manual/introduction/overview.html

The basic layout of QGIS looks like this:

.Basic QGIS 2.14 layout

On the right you will see some "panels". You can drag these around the screen if you like. In addition, you can right click in the menu bars near the top of the window to select different panels.

If you accidentally remove a panel you can get it back by right clicking near the top of the page and reselecting the panel.

The *layers* panel shows you what data you currently have loaded into QGIS (see bottom left in above images: there is one layer loaded called *WAWater*). 

In the screen is also a panel for adding data, which is called the *Manage layers toolbar*:

NOTE: In the above image I have moved the toolbar to display horizontally; any of these toolbars or panels can be moved around by clicking and dragging them.

If you look below the actual data window, which in QGIS is called the *map canvas* (where in the above images the layer WAWater is displayed), you see some important information in what QGIS calls the *status bar*.

This contains the location of your mouse pointer in the *map canvas*, some information about scale and rotation of your map, and importantly the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection[projection]. Map projections all have something called an *EPSG* number, so for example the British National Grid is http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/osgb-1936-british-national-grid/[EPSG:27700], the global WGS84 projection is http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/[EPSG:4326], and WGS UTM coordinates for the northern hemisphere are *EPSG:326XX* where the XX is the zone number, and *EPSG:327XX* is for the southern hemisphere. You can read more on projections in <<Projections and transformations,our appendix>>. 

Now that you have some idea about what the main QGIS window looks like, it is time to move on and add some data.
