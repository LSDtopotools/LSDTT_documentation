== Introduction

Your phone and your fancy computer with a fruit-based operating system have lots of nice icons that you tap, click or swipe to get apps and programs. These have been designed by someone with a degree in design from the Glasgow School of Art and a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford. That person's usually has a cool Gaelic name like Mhairi but grew up in Hong Kong, Phuket and Hartford, Connecticut and in her spare time has a closed loop organic farm that produces the best Tilapia this side of Manaus. 

Unfortunately for you, you need to use some scientific software partially programmed by someone named Mudd who grew up in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside,_California[Riverside]. There is no fancy user interface. There are no icons at all! The software runs in Linux. Why do scientists make everything so difficult!!!

Well, it turns out that it is much, much, much easier to install the common tools scientists use within Linux (MacOS is built on top of Linux). Also, although you will not believe it at first, doing things in Linux via the command line is faster than clicking on buttons. There is a reason most programmers still use this interface. 

Modern Linux operating systems like https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu] or https://www.debian.org/[Debian] have windowing systems like, uh, Windows and MacOS but in this section we will use something called the *shell*, which is a command line tool (you type commands onto a line). 

If you really want to learn about the shell you should go to the https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/[software carpentry website]. What you will find here are the commands that are essential for working with our software, link:index.html[LSDTopoTools], which are a subset of what you will find in the https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/[software carpentry] tutorials.
