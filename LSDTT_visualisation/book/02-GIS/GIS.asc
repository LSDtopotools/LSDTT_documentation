
== Using a GIS to look at *LSDTopoTools* data

*LSDTopoTools* outputs both raster and vector data. If you don't know what those are please see our link:LSDTT_introduction_to_geospatial_data.html.html[section on geospatial data]. 

If you want specific instructions for loading data please see our link:LSDTT_QGIS.html[QGIS section].

=== Raster data

Our raster datasets are in the http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html[ENVI bil] format. We like this format because it is simple but contains all the georeferencing information you need to load it into a GIS. 

* The ENVI bil format can be read by both ArcMap and https://www.qgis.org/en/site/[QGIS]. 
* You can convert it to other formats link:LSDTT_introduction_to_geospatial_data.html#_gdal[using GDAL]. Note that QGIS has GDAL built in. 

=== Vector data

*LSDTopoTools* also produces vector data. This vector data is almost always point data. Points with locations and attributes are printed to file, and you need to get this into your GIS. *LSDTopoTools* outputs point data in two formats:

* csv format: This is comma seperated value. 
** Most of our csv data files include the latitude and longitude of the points. 
** If you import csv data into a GIS, you need to tell it the coordinate system. *If the csv file has latitude and longitude headers, the coordinate system is WGS-84 which is the same as http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/[EPSG:4326]*
* http://geojson.org/[Geojson] format. Some of our *LSDTopoTools* programs allow you to convert csv files into geojson files. 
** Geojson files contain georeferencing, so you can load them as victor data directly into a GIS: you don't need to tell the GIS what coordinate system the data is in. 
** Geojson data is also compatble with many web mapping formats, like https://d3js.org/[d3.js] or http://leafletjs.com/[leaflet].
** Unfortunately, Geojson files are *huge* so if you are processing big datasets and are writing geojson data you will vey quickly end up filling your hard disk!
