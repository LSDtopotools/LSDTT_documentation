
== Basic LSDTopoTools visualisation

Okay, we are going to take you through some basic visualisation using *LSDMappingTools*. 

=== Getting our *LSDMappingTools* and other tools

Our vagrant setup has no graphic interface (you only interact with it through a terminal) so we suggest using your host operating system for python. 

. You need to clone our repository https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[LSDMappingTools]. 
+
WARNING: At the moment https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[LSDMappingTools] is a complete mess. It currently serves as a bit of a sandbox for visualisation development. One day we will clean it all up and make a nice, pretty release. But for now I'm afraid you'll need to rely on this repository. 
+
. If you don't want to install https://git-scm.com/[git] on your host operating system, you can clone the repository from your vagrant machine. Because of the clever way vagrant works you will be able to use these files in you host operating system.
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools.git
----
+
NOTE: In your host operating system these files will not be in `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects`. They will be within the `VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Git_projects` directory (wherever you put it. On windows I put mine in the `C` directory). 
+
. Once you have this repository you can move on to our examples in the next chapter.

=== A note on the test datasets

We include the test datasets within the *LSDMappingTools* repository but all of these are generated using *LSDTopoTools*. 

The datasets are
* raster
* hillshade
* basins
* channel network
* some other crap
