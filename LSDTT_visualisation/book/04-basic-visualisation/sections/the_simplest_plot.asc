=== Your first LSDMappingTools plots

The good news here is that installing the LSDTT python toolchain is more difficult than creating your first plot. If your python environment is working you are already most of the way there!

We will walk through this example using the command line. You need to use the operating system within which you installed the LSDTT python environment. If you don't know what that is read the <<Installing the LSDTopoTools python toolchain,installation section>>. 

. Make sure your LSDTT python enviroment is activated:
+
[source,console]
----
> activate LSDTT
----
+
.. In windows you will need to be in a `cmd.exe` window.
.. In linux or MacOS you might need to type `source activate LSDTT` to get the environment to work. 
.. If the environment is loaded you should see it in parentheses before the command prompt, e.g., `(LSDTT) >` or `(LSDTT) $`. 
+
. Navigate to the folder in the `LSDMappingTools` repository called `Tests`.
+
. Call the `LSDMappingTools_test.py` python script. This script is called with a single number: 1,2 or 3. These make different plots. 

==== A basic draped hillshade

This creates a very basic draped hillshade. It needs a elevation raster and a hillshade raster:

==== A hillshade with some basins

This creates a very basic hillshade with some basins plotted. It needs the elevation, hillshade, and basin raster, and a `_BasinInfo.csv` file (all of which are included in the test data folder):

==== A hillshade with some channels

This creates a very hillshade with a channel network. The channels come from a csv file that is derived from a chi data map. You can read about how to generate these in our link::LSDTT_basic_usage.html#_more_advanced_options_in_lsdtt_basicmetrics[LSDTT basic analysis documentation].
