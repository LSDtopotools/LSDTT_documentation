=== Your first LSDMappingTools plot

The good news here is that installing the LSDTT python toolchain is more difficult than creating your first plot. If your python environment is working you are already most of the way there!

We will walk through this example using the command line. You need to use the operating system within which you installed the LSDTT python enviroment. If you don't know what that is read the <<Installing the LSDTopoTools python toolchain,installation section>>. 

. Make sure your LSDTT python enviroment is activated:
+
[source,console]
----
> activate LSDTT
----
+
.. In windows you will need to be in a `cmd.exe` window.
.. In linux or MacOS you might need to type `source activate LSDTT` to get the enviroment to work. 
.. If the enviroment is loaded you should see it in parentheses before the command prompt, e.g., `(LSDTT) >` or `(LSDTT) $`. 
+
. Navigate to the folder in the `LSDMappingTools` repository called `Tests`
