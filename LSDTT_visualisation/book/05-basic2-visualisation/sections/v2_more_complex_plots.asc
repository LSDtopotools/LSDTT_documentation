=== More complex plots with PlotBasicRasters.py

.Reminder of basic call to PlotBasicRasters.py
*****************************************************
* First you need to be in the LSDTopoTools python environment. Read the section on <<Getting our LSDMappingTools and other tools>> and make sure you `activate` the LSDTT python environment. 
* The the components of a call are:
** The call to the actual python script: `python PlotBasicRasters.py`
** The directory of your data: `-dir \My\Data\Location`
** The prefix of the data files `-fname RasterPrefix`
** Then any optional flags you want. To see your choices run `python PlotBasicRasters.py -h` 
*****************************************************

We are now going to get a bit more complex and plot some basins and channels. 
The structure of the python call remain the same, we just call different flags for `PlotBasicRasters.py`.

==== A basic channel plot PlotBasicRasters.py

In the first example we will create a very simple channel plot. 

Simply call:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python PlotBasicRasters.py -dir c:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Topographic_projects\LSDTT_chi_examples -fname Mega_divide -dpi 100 -PCh True
----
+
The figure looks like this:
+

The default of this plot is to plot the channels coloured by elevation, using a blue colour scale. Like most features of `PlotBasicRasters.py` there are a number of flags that can modify this plot. Many of the options involve selecting basins. So we will explore basin selection next. 

==== Plotting basins

Channels conduct water, sediment and nutrients downslope, but they can also communicate tectonic signals upslope. In many landscapes they set the pace of landscape evolution. Channels are orgaonised into connected networks, contained within drainage basins. 

*LSDTopoTools* analyses frequently involve sorting and selecting drainage basins. *LSDMappingTools* is designed to ingest and use the drainage basin information produced by *LSDTopoTools*. 

. We can start with a very basic basin plot:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python PlotBasicRasters.py -dir c:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Topographic_projects\LSDTT_chi_examples -fname Mega_divide -dpi 100 -PB True
----
+
. The resulting figure looks like this:
+
.A simple basin plot.
