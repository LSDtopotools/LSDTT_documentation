=== Getting the example data

The data we will use in this section is in the `LSDTT_chi_examples` repository: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_chi_examples

The data is based on a series of catchements draining the southern side of the Shillong Plateau in India, one of the wettest places on Earth. The data we will use has been derived from using our link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[channel steepness tools], but we won't make you run the code, we simply provide the processed data. 

These are:

* `Mega_divide.bil`: The topographic raster
* `Mega_divide_HS.bil`: hillshade
* `Mega_divide_AllBasins.bil`: A raster map of the basins
