=== Getting the example data

The data we will use in this section is in the `LSDTT_chi_examples` repository: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_chi_examples

The data is based on a series of catchements draining the southern side of the Shillong Plateau in India, one of the wettest places on Earth. The data we will use has been derived from using our link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[channel steepness tools], but we won't make you run the code, we simply provide the processed data. 

These are:

* `Mega_divide.bil`: The topographic raster
* `Mega_divide_hs.bil`: hillshade
* `Mega_divide_AllBasins.bil`: A raster map of the basins
* `Mega_divide_AllBasinsInfo.csv`: A comma separated value file that contains information about the basins. It is generated using the `print_basin_raster: true` option in our link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[chi mapping tools].
* `Mega_divide_Maskedchi.bil`: A raster that contains the chi coordinates of this landscape.
* `Mega_divide_chi_data_map.csv`: A csv file containing information about the channel network. It contains information like the area location, stream order, basin number, source number and chi coordinate of the extracted channel network. This comes from using the link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[chi mapping tool] with the option `print_chi_data_maps: true`.

. To get the data, you need to clone the repository https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_chi_examples. If you are using a link:LSDTT_installation.html#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[vagrant box] or a link:LSDTT_installation.html#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_docker[docker container] you should probably put this into the `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects` directory.

=== Getting LSDMappingTools

You also need to get https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTTMappingTools[LSDMappingTools]. See the section <<Getting our LSDMappingTools and other tools>>. Please don't just skim that section, it contains important information that is essential for getting the tool working properly.
