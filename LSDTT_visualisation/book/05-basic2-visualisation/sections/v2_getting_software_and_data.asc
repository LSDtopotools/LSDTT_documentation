=== Getting the example data

The data we will use in this section comes with the full *LSDTopoTools* example data. 
These datasets are available in a repository: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets

==== Getting example data in a docker container:

. Start the docker container:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -it -v C:\LSDTopoTools\:/LSDTopoTools lsdtopotools/lsdtt_viz_docker
----
+
. Run a script to grab and unpack the data:
+
[source,console]
----
$ Get_LSDTT_example_data.sh
----
+
. The data for these examples is in `/LSDTopoTools/data/ExampleTopoDatasets/ChiAnalysisData/Meghalaya`

==== Getting the data in your native system

. Find a place to put the data. 
+
. Download and unzip the data. In a terminal you would do this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
----


=== What is in the example data

There are many datasets in the example data, but in the directory you will be using, we will focus on a specific location. 

The data is based on a series of catchements draining the southern side of the Shillong Plateau in India, one of the wettest places on Earth. The data we will use has been derived from using our link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[channel steepness tools], but we won't make you run the code, we simply provide the processed data. 

These are:

* `Mega_divide.bil`: The topographic raster
* `Mega_divide_hs.bil`: hillshade
* `Mega_divide_AllBasins.bil`: A raster map of the basins
* `Mega_divide_AllBasinsInfo.csv`: A comma separated value file that contains information about the basins. It is generated using the `print_basin_raster: true` option in our link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[chi mapping tools].
* `Mega_divide_Maskedchi.bil`: A raster that contains the chi coordinates of this landscape.
* `Mega_divide_chi_data_map.csv`: A csv file containing information about the channel network. It contains information like the area location, stream order, basin number, source number and chi coordinate of the extracted channel network. This comes from using the link:LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[chi mapping tool] with the option `print_chi_data_maps: true`.

=== Getting LSDMappingTools

You also need to get https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTTMappingTools[LSDMappingTools]. See the section <<Installing the LSDTopoTools python toolchain>>. Please don't just skim that section, it contains important information that is essential for getting the tool working properly.
