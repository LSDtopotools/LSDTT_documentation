== Troubleshooting Docker

At the moment our link:LSDTT_installation.html#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_docker[Docker installation] is provided by a 3rd party. We have not extensively tested this because it does not work on our machines (you need either MacOS or Windows 10 Enterprise). The *LSDTopoTools* developer who works on a fruit-based operating system, http://swdg.io/[Stuart Grieve], is trying to get an in-house implementation running but for most Docker questions I am afraid there won't be that much support.

[source,console]

chmod 0744 /bin/install.sh
