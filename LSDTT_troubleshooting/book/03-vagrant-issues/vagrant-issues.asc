== Troubleshooting vagrant problems

=== Vagrant up doesn't work

Sometimes, on slower machines, `vagrant up` times out. Just run `vagrant up` again. 

=== Vagrant cant see my files

Make sure your the directory structure on the host machine is correct: 

[source,console]
----
| Vagrantboxes
    | Ubuntu_vagrant
      | vagrantfile
    | LSDTopoTools
----

If the LSDTopoTools directory is in the wrong place or misspelled (*it is case sensitive*) then vagrant will not sync your files. 

=== Vagrant is completely messed up

To start again from scratch, go to the directory with the vagrantfile and run:

[source,consol]
----
$ vagrant destroy
----

WARNING: This will erase your Ubuntu box and start again. Meaning you will have to download the 700Mb operating system again.
