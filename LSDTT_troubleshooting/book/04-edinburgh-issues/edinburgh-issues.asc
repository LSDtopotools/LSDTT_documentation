== Troubleshooting problems on Edinburgh servers

=== NX doesn't work

Sometimes, NX decides it won't work for ambigous reasons. You can always log on to our servers via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell[*ssh*]. An SSH program is avaialble in all computing labs. The address of the geoscience servers is `ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk`.

=== I can't see my files

* Undergraduates: Your normal file storage area at Edinburgh is generally refered to as the *M drive*. You have a second drive, usually called the *T drive*, that you acces via the netdata path. To activate that path link:LSDTT_installation.html#_mapping_your_network_drive[follow these instructions].
* Taught MSc students: We think this works the same as undergraduates.
* MSc by research: We think this works the same as PhD students.
* PhD students/Staff: When you ssh/NX into the servers you will be in your *M drive*. You will need to create a shortcut to your *T drive* or and *shared drives*
